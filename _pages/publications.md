## Publications

\* = (co-)supervised

Publications are managed using [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar). The bibliography is stored in `_data/publications.bib` and can be exported directly from your Zotero library. See `ZOTERO_WORKFLOW.md` for detailed instructions.

Your old manual publication list has been backed up to _pages/publications.md.backup
Once you've fully migrated to the BibTeX workflow, you can delete that backup.
