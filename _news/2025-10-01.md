**New papers:** Jorge Baño-Medina recently published three excellent papers building [large ensembles](http://doi.org/10.1029/2024MS004734) of AI weather models, their use for [attribution](http://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-24-0090.1), and how well they represent [atmospheric physics](http://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-025-00949-6). It was a pleasure working with him on them!
