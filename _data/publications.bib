	abstract = {In convective clouds, satellite‐observed deepening or increased amount of clouds with increasing aerosol concentration has been reported and is sometimes interpreted as aerosol‐induced invigoration of the clouds. However, such correlations can be affected by meteorological factors that affect both aerosol and clouds, as well as observational issues. In this study, we examine the behavior in a 660 × 660 km2 region of the South Pacific during June 2007, previously found by Koren et al. (2014) to show strong correlation between cloud fraction, cloud top pressure, and aerosols, using a cloud‐resolving model with meteorological boundary conditions specified from a reanalysis. The model assumes constant aerosol loading, yet reproduces vigorous clouds at times of high real‐world aerosol concentrations. Days with high‐ and low‐aerosol loading exhibit deep‐convective and shallow clouds, respectively, in both observations and the simulation. Synoptic analysis shows that vigorous clouds occur at times of strong surface troughs, which are associated with high winds and advection of boundary layer air from the Southern Ocean where sea‐salt aerosol is abundant, thus accounting for the high correlation. Our model results show that aerosol‐cloud relationships can be explained by coexisting but independent wind‐aerosol and wind‐cloud relationships and that no cloud condensation nuclei effect is required. Satellite observations show an apparent invigoration of the convective clouds induced by aerosol Model with fixed aerosol loading simulates vigorous clouds at times of high real‐world aerosol concentrations Wind‐cloud and wind‐aerosol relationship explains the apparent convective invigoration},

The same CTM reproduces the observed vertical profiles of sulfate and elemental carbon aerosols, which indicate sharp decreases from the boundary layer to the FT due to wet scavenging. Our results suggest a large, sustained source of SOA in the FT from oxidation of long-lived volatile organic compounds.

Cloud breakup leads to a lower cloud radiative effect due to the lower cloud amount. Here we use realistic Lagrangian large eddy simulations along a 3‐day trajectory, evaluated with satellite observations, to investigate the timing of Sc breakup in response to aerosol conditions. We show that the timing of the breakup is strongly modulated by the diurnal cycle and large‐scale meteorology but varies systematically with the initial aerosol concentration: the more polluted the clouds, the later the breakup. This indicates that the cloud radiative effect via cloud cover adjustments is not saturated, in contrast to the effect of aerosol on cloud albedo at fixed cloudiness, which weakens with increasing aerosol levels. The results also show that the cloud radiative impact of anthropogenic aerosol is strongest far from its origin over land.

This value is considerably weaker than the estimate of −1.2 W m−2 in AR4. A part of the difference can be explained by an offset of +0.2 W m−2 which AR5 added to all published estimates that only considered the solar spectrum, in order to account for adjustments in the terrestrial spectrum. We find that, in the CMIP5 multimodel median, the ERF in the terrestrial spectrum is small, unless microphysical effects on ice- and mixed-phase clouds are parameterized. In the latter case it is large but accompanied by a very strong ERF in the solar spectrum. The total adjustments can be separated into microphysical adjustments (aerosol “effects”) and thermodynamic adjustments. Using a kernel technique, we quantify the latter and find that the rapid thermodynamic adjustments of water vapor and temperature profiles are small. Observation-based constraints on these model results are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Eight atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are forced with observed historical (1871–2010) monthly sea surface temperature and sea ice variations using the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project II data set. The AGCMs therefore have a similar temperature pattern and trend to that of observed historical climate change. The AGCMs simulate a spread in climate feedback similar to that seen in coupled simulations of the response to CO2 quadrupling. However, the feedbacks are robustly more stabilizing and the effective climate sensitivity (EffCS) smaller. This is due to a pattern effect, whereby the pattern of observed historical sea surface temperature change gives rise to more negative cloud and longwave clear‐sky feedbacks. Assuming the patterns of long‐term temperature change simulated by models, and the radiative response to them, are credible; this implies that existing constraints on EffCS from historical energy budget variations give values that are too low and overly constrained, particularly at the upper end. For example, the pattern effect increases the long‐term Otto et al. (2013, https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo1836) EffCS median and 5–95\% confidence interval from 1.9 K (0.9–5.0 K) to 3.2 K (1.5–8.1 K). Recent decades have seen cooling over the eastern tropical Pacific and Southern Oceans while temperatures rise globally. Climate models indicate that these regional features, and others, are not expected to continue into the future under sustained forcing from atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. This matters because climate sensitivity depends on the pattern of warming, so if the past has warmed differently from what we expect in the future, then climate sensitivity estimated from the historical record may not apply to the future. We investigate this with a suite of climate models and show that climate sensitivity simulated for observed historical climate change is smaller than for long‐term carbon dioxide increases. The results imply that historical energy budget changes only weakly constrain climate sensitivity. Climate sensitivity simulated for observed surface temperature change is smaller than for long‐term carbon dioxide increases Observed historical energy budget constraints give climate sensitivity values that are too low and overly constrained, particularly at the upper end Historical energy budget changes only weakly constrain climate sensitivity},

Results show that near-cloud contamination accounts for approximately 40\% of the satellite-derived aerosol-cloud relationship. When contamination is removed and the effect of meteorological covariation is minimized, a strong physical aerosol effect on cloud cover remains. Averaged over all stations and after correcting for contamination, the daytime solar and total (solar + IR) radiative forcing is −52 W/m2 and −19 W/m2, respectively, due to both direct and indirect aerosol effects for aerosol optical depths (τ) between 0 and 0.3.

	abstract = {Global mean precipitation changes due to climate change were previously shown to be relatively small and well constrained by the energy budget. However, local precipitation changes can be much more significant. In this paper we propose that for large enough scales, for which the water budget is closed (precipitation [P] roughly equals evaporation [E]), changes in P approach the small global mean value. However, for smaller scales, for which P and E are not necessarily equal and convergence of water vapor still plays a role, changes in P could be much larger due to dynamical contributions. Using 40 years of two reanalysis data sets, 39 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models and additional numerical simulations, we identify the scale of transition in the importance of the different terms in the water budget to precipitation to be {\textasciitilde}3,500–4,000 km and demonstrate its relation to the spatial scale of precipitation changes under climate change. Predicting precipitation changes due to climate change is of great importance for society. We propose that the present‐day characteristic scale of the hydrological cycle (for which precipitation roughly equals evaporation) predicts the spatial scale of future precipitation changes under global warming. For smaller scales than the characteristic scale of the hydrological cycle, changes in precipitation could be much larger than the global mean change due to water vapor convergence contributions. However, above this scale the precipitation changes approach the relatively small global mean change.

Radar reflectivity profiles were composited as a function of temperature, with particle type superimposed to depict how storm regimes exert different particle habit structures. The deep convective system was found to have a relatively simple structure, which is dominated by randomly oriented ice, followed by snow and rain at the bottom, whereas the shallow cold system consisting high cloud tops with precipitation far below contains various hydrometeors, such as ice plates and drizzles. The deep convective system was further analyzed to demonstrate how the vertical microphysical structure tends to systematically transition from nonprecipitating to precipitating characteristics with differing cloud top buoyancies indicative of the “life stage” of convective development. The analysis offers a link between dynamical characteristics of convective systems and their inner hydrometeors structures. Clouds are composed of liquid water droplets and condensed ice crystals or a mixture of both. Compared to liquid droplets, ice crystals are generally larger in size and, even with the same mass, allow more sunlight to reach the Earth's surface. Ice crystals also grow faster and end up falling as snow or melted rain, shortening the lifetime of a cloud. The phase states of these liquid and ice particles do not only persist over the lifetime of the cloud, but thermodynamic transitions between them often occur. Although these cloud‐precipitation and thermodynamic phase processes occur in the vertical direction of the atmosphere, the vertical internal phase compositions of cloud‐precipitation systems are still an open question in the atmospheric sciences, resulting in uncertainties in the surface temperature estimations in warmed atmospheres. In our study, we integrated independent measurements from space, analyzed various precipitating clouds from shallow to towering convective systems, and revealed variabilities in the vertical particle constituents among the precipitating cloud regimes. Studying the “static” measurement in a more “dynamical” context, we also show the observational insight of how the vertical structure of deep convective systems changes from “cloud mode” to “precipitation mode” during the course of their development.

In this study, the SCM mode of version 5 of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) is shown to handle aerosol initialization and advection improperly, resulting in aerosol, cloud-droplet, and ice crystal concentrations which are typically much lower than observed or simulated by CAM5 in global mode. This deficiency has a major impact on stratiform cloud simulations but has little impact on convective case studies because aerosol is currently not used by CAM5 convective schemes and convective cases are typically longer in duration (so initialization is less important). By imposing fixed aerosol or cloud-droplet and crystal number concentrations, the aerosol issues described above can be avoided. Sensitivity studies using these idealizations suggest that the Meyers et al. (1992) ice nucleation scheme prevents mixed-phase cloud from existing by producing too many ice crystals. Microphysics is shown to strongly deplete cloud water in stratiform cases, indicating problems with sequential splitting in CAM5 and the need for careful interpretation of output from sequentially split climate models. Droplet concentration in the general circulation model (GCM) version of CAM5 is also shown to be far too low ({\textasciitilde} 25 cm−3) at the southern Great Plains (SGP) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site.},

Traditionally such dependencies have been ignored when climate models have been evaluated against observational data, which makes it difficult to assess whether any given model is simulating observed climate for the right reasons. The new statistic uses Gaussian Markov random fields for estimating field and space dependencies within a first-order grid point neighborhood structure. We illustrate the ability of Gaussian Markov random fields to represent empirical estimates of field and space covariances using "witch hat" graphs. We further use the new statistic to evaluate the tropical response of a climate model (CAM3.1) to changes in two parameters important to its representation of cloud and precipitation physics. Overall, the inclusion of dependency information did not alter significantly the recognition of those regions of parameter space that best approximated observations. However, there were some qualitative differences in the shape of the response surface that suggest how such a measure could affect estimates of model uncertainty.},

These are in good agreement with the likely Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) range, noting that AR5 estimates were derived from a combination of climate models, observations and expert judgement. The ranges of future projections of temperature and ranges of estimates of ECS, TCR and TCRE are somewhat sensitive to the prior distributions of ECS∕TCR parameters but less sensitive to the ERF from a doubling of CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ or the observational temperature dataset used to constrain the ensemble. Taking these sensitivities into account, there is no evidence to suggest that the median and credible range of observationally constrained TCR or ECS differ from climate model-derived estimates. The range of temperature projections under RCP8.5 for 2081–2100 in the constrained FAIR model ensemble is lower than the emissions-based estimate reported in AR5 by half a degree, owing to differences in forcing assumptions and ECS∕TCR distributions.},

Yet, there are sampling issues. MODIS' specific orbital geometry, convolved with the need to avoid bright surfaces (glint, desert, clouds, etc.), means that AOD can be under- or over-sampled in places. When deriving downstream products, such as daily or monthly gridded AOD, one must consider the spatial and temporal density of the measurements relative to the gradients of the true AOD. Additionally, retrieval confidence criteria should be considered. Averaged products are highly dependent on choices made for data aggregation and weighting, and sampling errors can be further propagated when deriving regional or global “mean” AOD. Different choices for aggregation and weighting result in estimates of regional and global means varying by 30\% or more. The impacts of a particular averaging algorithm vary by region and surface type and can be shown to represent different tolerance for clouds and retrieval confidence.},

Daily simulations were analyzed and three different types of precipitation features were identified by the classification tree algorithm. The statistical characteristics of these features (i.e., maximum value, mean value, and variance) were calculated to quantify the difference between the dynamical cores and changing resolutions. Even with the simple and smooth topography in the idealized setups, complexity in the precipitation fields simulated by the models develops quickly. The classification tree algorithm using objective thresholding successfully detected different types of precipitation features even as the complexity of the precipitation field increased. The results show that the complexity and the bias introduced in small-scale phenomena due to the spectral transform method of CAM Eulerian spectral dynamical core is prominent, and is an important reason for its dissimilarity from the FV dynamical core. The resolvable scales, both in horizontal and vertical dimensions, have significant effect on the simulation of precipitation. The results of this study also suggest that an efficient and informative study about the biases produced by GCMs should involve daily (or even hourly) output (rather than monthly mean) analysis over local scales.},

The new analytical equation is accurate and much more efficient than the previous heuristic equation, which suffers from the truncation error in association with the digitalization of the overlap areas. Global test simulations with the new analytical formula in an offline mode showed that the maximum cumulus overlap simulates more surface precipitation flux than the random cumulus overlap. On the other hand, the maximum stratus overlap simulates less surface precipitation flux than random stratus overlap, which is due to the increase in the evaporation rate of convective precipitation from the random to maximum stratus overlap. The independent precipitation approximation (IPA) marginally decreases the surface precipitation flux, implying that IPA works well with other parameterizations. In contrast to the net production rate of precipitation and surface precipitation flux that increase when the cumulus and stratus are maximally and randomly overlapped, respectively, the global mean net radiative cooling and longwave cloud radiative forcing (LWCF) increase when the cumulus and stratus are randomly overlapped. On the global average, the vertical cloud overlap exerts larger impacts on the precipitation flux than on the radiation flux. The radiation scheme taking the subgrid variability of water vapor between the cloud and clear portions into account substantially increases the global mean LWCF in tropical deep convection and midlatitude storm track regions. An economical analytical equation was derived for the integrated vertical overlap of cumulus and stratus The new analytical equation is much more efficient than the previously proposed heuristic version and induces no truncation error The radiation scheme incorporating the subgrid variation of water vapor substantially increases the longwave cloud radiative forcing},

	abstract = {Large‐scale weather forecasting and climate models are beginning to reach horizontal resolutions of kilometers, at which common assumptions made in existing parameterization schemes of subgrid‐scale turbulence and convection—such as that they adjust instantaneously to changes in resolved‐scale dynamics—cease to be justifiable. Additionally, the common practice of representing boundary‐layer turbulence, shallow convection, and deep convection by discontinuously different parameterizations schemes, each with its own set of parameters, has contributed to the proliferation of adjustable parameters in large‐scale models. Here we lay the theoretical foundations for an extended eddy‐diffusivity mass‐flux (EDMF) scheme that has explicit time‐dependence and memory of subgrid‐scale variables and is designed to represent all subgrid‐scale turbulence and convection, from boundary layer dynamics to deep convection, in a unified manner. Coherent up and downdrafts in the scheme are represented as prognostic plumes that interact with their environment and potentially with each other through entrainment and detrainment. The more isotropic turbulence in their environment is represented through diffusive fluxes, with diffusivities obtained from a turbulence kinetic energy budget that consistently partitions turbulence kinetic energy between plumes and environment. The cross‐sectional area of up and downdrafts satisfies a prognostic continuity equation, which allows the plumes to cover variable and arbitrarily large fractions of a large‐scale grid box and to have life cycles governed by their own internal dynamics. Relatively simple preliminary proposals for closure parameters are presented and are shown to lead to a successful simulation of shallow convection, including a time‐dependent life cycle. An extended eddy‐diffusivity mass‐flux (EDMF) scheme is presented that is prognostic and has variable plume area fractions The new EDMF scheme consistently partitions flow variables (including turbulence kinetic energy) between plumes and the environment In first tests, it successfully reproduces the average condition and transient life cycles of shallow convection},

	abstract = {Dynamical weather and climate prediction models underpin many studies of the Earth system and hold the promise of being able to make robust projections of future climate change based on physical laws. However, simulations from these models still show many differences compared with observations. Machine learning has been applied to solve certain prediction problems with great success, and recently it's been proposed that this could replace the role of physically‐derived dynamical weather and climate models to give better quality simulations. Here, instead, a framework using machine learning together with physically‐derived models is tested, in which it is learnt how to correct the errors of the latter from timestep to timestep. This maintains the physical understanding built into the models, whilst allowing performance improvements, and also requires much simpler algorithms and less training data. This is tested in the context of simulating the chaotic Lorenz '96 system, and it is shown that the approach yields models that are stable and that give both improved skill in initialised predictions and better long‐term climate statistics. Improvements in long‐term statistics are smaller than for single time‐step tendencies, however, indicating that it would be valuable to develop methods that target improvements on longer time scales. Future strategies for the development of this approach and possible applications to making progress on important scientific problems are discussed. Machine learning provides a method of deducing better Earth system models from data. It is simpler to correct errors in physically‐derived models than to replace them and learn from scratch. Robust improvements in forecast and climate diagnostics are shown for the chaotic Lorenz '96 system.},

Major changes with respect to its predecessor affect the representation of shortwave radiative transfer, the height of the model top. Minor changes have been made to model tuning and convective triggering. Several model configurations, differing in horizontal and vertical resolution, are compared. As horizontal resolution is increased beyond T63, the simulated climate improves but changes are incremental; major biases appear to be limited by the parameterization of small-scale physical processes, such as clouds and convection. Higher vertical resolution in the middle atmosphere leads to a systematic reduction in temperature biases in the upper troposphere, and a better representation of the middle atmosphere and its modes of variability. ECHAM6 represents the present climate as well as, or better than, its predecessor. The most marked improvements are evident in the circulation of the extratropics. ECHAM6 continues to have a good representation of tropical variability. A number of biases, however, remain. These include a poor representation of low-level clouds, systematic shifts in major precipitation features, biases in the partitioning of precipitation between land and sea (particularly in the tropics), and midlatitude jets that appear to be insufficiently poleward. The response of ECHAM6 to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is similar to that of ECHAM5. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the mixed-resolution (T63L95) configuration is between 2.9 and 3.4 K and is somewhat larger for the 47 level model.

	abstract = {We present a method to describe the relationship between particle dry diameter and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity using a single hygroscopicity parameter κ. Values of the hygroscopicity parameter are between 0.5 and 1.4 for highly-CCN-active salts such as sodium chloride, between 0.01 and 0.5 for slightly to very hygroscopic organic species, and 0 for nonhygroscopic components. Observations indicate that atmospheric particulate matter is typically characterized by 0.1{\textless}κ{\textless}0.9. If compositional data are available and if the hygroscopicity parameter of each component is known, a multicomponent hygroscopicity parameter can be computed by weighting component hygroscopicity parameters by their volume fractions in the mixture. In the absence of information on chemical composition, experimental data for complex, multicomponent particles can be fitted to obtain the hygroscopicity parameter. The hygroscopicity parameter can thus also be used to conveniently model the CCN activity of atmospheric particles, including those containing insoluble components. We confirm the applicability of the hygroscopicity parameter and its mixing rule by applying it to published hygroscopic diameter growth factor and CCN-activation data for single- and multi-component particles containing varying amounts of inorganic, organic and surface active compounds. We suggest that κ may be fit to CCN data assuming σs/a=0.072 J m−2 and present a table of κ derived for this value and T=298.15 K. The predicted hygroscopicities for mixtures that contain the surfactant fulvic acid agree within uncertainties with the measured values. It thus appears that this approach is adequate for predicting CCN activity of mixed particles containing surface active materials, but the generality of this assumption requires further verification.},

The annual mean ratio of activated cloud condensation nuclei (NCCN) to the total number concentration of particles (NCN), known as the activated fraction A, shows a similar functional dependence on supersaturation S at many locations – exceptions to this being certain marine locations, a free troposphere site and background sites in south-west Germany and northern Finland. The use of total number concentration of particles above 50 and 100 nm diameter when calculating the activated fractions (A50 and A100, respectively) renders a much more stable dependence of A on S; A50 and A100 also reveal the effect of the size distribution on CCN activation. With respect to chemical composition, it was found that the hygroscopicity of aerosol particles as a function of size differs among locations. The hygroscopicity parameter κ decreased with an increasing size at a continental site in south-west Germany and fluctuated without any particular size dependence across the observed size range in the remote tropical North Atlantic and rural central Hungary. At all other locations κ increased with size. In fact, in Hyytiälä, Vavihill, Jungfraujoch and Pallas the difference in hygroscopicity between Aitken and accumulation mode aerosol was statistically significant at the 5 \% significance level. In a boreal environment the assumption of a size-independent κ can lead to a potentially substantial overestimation of NCCN at S levels above 0.6 \%. The same is true for other locations where κ was found to increase with size. While detailed information about aerosol hygroscopicity can significantly improve the prediction of NCCN, total aerosol number concentration and aerosol size distribution remain more important parameters. The seasonal and diurnal patterns of CCN activation and hygroscopic properties vary among three long-term locations, highlighting the spatial and temporal variability of potential aerosol–cloud interactions in various environments.},

	abstract = {We use the new GLOMAP model of global aerosol microphysics to investigate the sensitivity of modelled sulfate and sea salt aerosol properties to uncertainties in the driving microphysical processes and compare these uncertainties with those associated with aerosol and precursor gas emissions. Overall, we conclude that uncertainties in microphysical processes have a larger effect on global sulfate and sea salt derived condensation nuclei (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations than uncertainties in present-day sulfur emissions. Our simulations suggest that uncertainties in predicted sulfate and sea salt CCN abundances due to poorly constrained microphysical processes are likely to be of a similar magnitude to long-term changes in sulfate and sea salt CCN due to changes in anthropogenic emissions. A microphysical treatment of the global sulfate aerosol allows the uncertainty in climate-relevant aerosol properties to be attributed to specific processes in a way that has not been possible with simpler aerosol schemes. In particular we conclude that: (1) changes in the binary H2SO4-H2O nucleation rate and condensation rate of gaseous H2SO4 cause a shift in the vertical location of the upper tropospheric CN layer by as much as 3 km, while the shape of the CN profile is essentially pre-served (2) uncertainties in the binary H2SO4-H2O nucleation rate have a relatively insignificant effect on marine boundary layer (MBL) aerosol properties; (3) emitting a fraction of anthropogenic SO2 as particulates (to represent production of sulfate particles in power plant plumes below the scale of the model grid (which is of the order of 300 km)) has the potential to change the global mean MBL sulfate-derived CN concentrations by up to 72\%, and changes of up to a factor 20 can occur in polluted continental regions; (4) predicted global mean MBL sulfate and sea salt CCN concentrations change by 10 to 60\% when several microphysical processes are changed within reasonable uncertainty ranges; (5) sulfate and sea salt derived CCN concentrations are particularly sensitive to primary particle emissions, with global mean MBL sulfate and sea salt CCN changing by up to 27\% and local concentrations over continental regions changing by more than 100\% when the percentage of anthropogenic SO2 emitted as particulates is changed from 0 to 5\%; (6) large changes in sea spray flux have insignificant effects on global sulfate aerosol except when the mass accommodation coefficient of sulfuric acid on the salt particles is set unrealistically low.},

Instead of empirical microphysical estimates, here macroscopic variables are analyzed to address the influence of aerosol particles and meteorological descriptors on instantaneous cloud albedo and the radiative effect of shallow liquid water clouds. Long-term ground-based measurements from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program over the Southern Great Plains are used. A broad statistical analysis was performed on 14 years of coincident measurements of low clouds, aerosol, and meteorological properties. Two cases representing conflicting results regarding the relationship between the aerosol and the cloud radiative effect were selected and studied in greater detail. Microphysical estimates are shown to be very uncertain and to depend strongly on the methodology, retrieval technique and averaging scale. For this continental site, the results indicate that the influence of the aerosol on the shallow cloud radiative effect and albedo is weak and that macroscopic cloud properties and dynamics play a much larger role in determining the instantaneous cloud radiative effect compared to microphysical effects. On a daily basis, aerosol shows no correlation with cloud radiative properties (correlation = −0.01 ± 0.03), whereas the liquid water path shows a clear signal (correlation = 0.56 ± 0.02).},

Under the assumption of either complete solubility, or complete insolubility of a component, it is not necessary to explicitly include that component's solubility into the single parameter framework. This is not the case if sparingly soluble materials are present. In this work we explicitly account for solubility by modifying the single parameter equations. We demonstrate that sensitivity to the actual value of solubility emerges only in the regime of 2×10−1–5×10−4, where the solubility values are expressed as volume of solute per unit volume of water present in a saturated solution.

The adjoint efficiently and accurately calculates the sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) to all parameterization inputs (e.g., updraft velocity, water uptake coefficient, aerosol number and hygroscopicity) with a single execution. The adjoint is then integrated within three dimensional (3-D) aerosol modeling frameworks to quantify the sensitivity of CDNC formation globally to each parameter. Sensitivities are computed for year-long executions of the NASA Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) Chemical Transport Model (CTM), using wind fields computed with the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Global Circulation Model (GCM) II', and the GEOS-Chem CTM, driven by meteorological input from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). We find that over polluted (pristine) areas, CDNC is more sensitive to updraft velocity and uptake coefficient (aerosol number and hygroscopicity). Over the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere, addition of anthropogenic or biomass burning aerosol is predicted to increase CDNC in contrast to coarse-mode sea salt which tends to decrease CDNC. Over the Southern Oceans, CDNC is most sensitive to sea salt, which is the main aerosol component of the region. Globally, CDNC is predicted to be less sensitive to changes in the hygroscopicity of the aerosols than in their concentration with the exception of dust where CDNC is very sensitive to particle hydrophilicity over arid areas. Regionally, the sensitivities differ considerably between the two frameworks and quantitatively reveal why the models differ considerably in their indirect forcing estimates.},

The evaluation of the simulated aerosol absorption optical depth with the AERONET sun-photometer network shows a good agreement in the large scale global patterns. On a regional basis it becomes evident that the update of the BC refractive indices to Bond and Bergstrom (2006) significantly improves the previous underestimation of the aerosol absorption optical depth. In the global annual-mean, absorption acts to reduce the short-wave anthropogenic aerosol top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative forcing clear-sky from −0.79 to −0.53 W m−2 (33\%) and all-sky from −0.47 to −0.13 W m−2 (72\%). Our results confirm that basic assumptions about the BC refractive index play a key role for aerosol absorption and radiative forcing. The effect of the usage of more accurate effective medium approximations is comparably small. We demonstrate that the diversity in the AeroCom land-surface albedo fields contributes to the uncertainty in the simulated anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcings: the usage of an upper versus lower bound of the AeroCom land albedos introduces a global annual-mean TOA forcing range of 0.19 W m−2 (36\%) clear-sky and of 0.12 W m−2 (92\%) all-sky. The consideration of black carbon inclusions on cloud radiative properties results in a small global annual-mean all-sky absorption of 0.05 W m−2 and a positive TOA forcing perturbation of 0.02 W m−2. The long-wave aerosol radiative effects are small for anthropogenic aerosols but become of relevance for the larger natural dust and sea-salt aerosols.},

The diverse sources of model uncertainty and the computational cost of running climate models make it difficult to isolate the main causes of aerosol ERF uncertainty and to understand how observations can be used to constrain it. We explore the aerosol ERF uncertainty by using fast model emulators to generate a very large set of aerosol–climate model variants that span the model uncertainty due to 27 parameters related to atmospheric and aerosol processes. Sensitivity analyses shows that the uncertainty in the ToA flux is dominated (around 80{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\%) by uncertainties in the physical atmosphere model, particularly parameters that affect cloud reflectivity. However, uncertainty in the change in ToA flux caused by aerosol emissions over the industrial period (the aerosol ERF) is controlled by a combination of uncertainties in aerosol (around 60{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\%) and physical atmosphere (around 40{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\%) parameters. Four atmospheric and aerosol parameters account for around 80{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of the uncertainty in short-wave ToA flux (mostly parameters that directly scale cloud reflectivity, cloud water content or cloud droplet concentrations), and these parameters also account for around 60{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of the aerosol ERF uncertainty. The common causes of uncertainty mean that constraining the modelled planetary brightness to tightly match satellite observations changes the lower 95{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% credible aerosol ERF value from −2.65 to −2.37{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}W{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m$^{\textrm{−2}}$.

These results show that, regardless of the fact that the ToA flux is 2 orders of magnitude larger than the aerosol ERF, the observed flux can constrain the uncertainty in ERF because their values are connected by constrainable process parameters. The key to reducing the aerosol ERF uncertainty further will be to identify observations that can additionally constrain individual parameter ranges and/or combined parameter effects, which can be achieved through sensitivity analysis of perturbed parameter ensembles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Airborne observations over the Amazon Basin showed high aerosol particle concentrations in the upper troposphere (UT) between 8 and 15 km altitude, with number densities (normalized to standard temperature and pressure) often exceeding those in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. The measurements were made during the German–Brazilian cooperative aircraft campaign ACRIDICON–CHUVA, where ACRIDICON stands for Aerosol, Cloud, Precipitation, and Radiation Interactions and Dynamics of Convective Cloud Systems and CHUVA is the acronym for Cloud Processes of the Main Precipitation Systems in Brazil: A Contribution to Cloud Resolving Modeling and to the GPM (global precipitation measurement), on the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO). The campaign took place in September–October 2014, with the objective of studying tropical deep convective clouds over the Amazon rainforest and their interactions with atmospheric trace gases, aerosol particles, and atmospheric radiation. Aerosol enhancements were observed consistently on all flights during which the UT was probed, using several aerosol metrics, including condensation nuclei (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentrations and chemical species mass concentrations. The UT particles differed sharply in their chemical composition and size distribution from those in the PBL, ruling out convective transport of combustion-derived particles from the boundary layer (BL) as a source. The air in the immediate outflow of deep convective clouds was depleted of aerosol particles, whereas strongly enhanced number concentrations of small particles ({\textless} 90 nm diameter) were found in UT regions that had experienced outflow from deep convection in the preceding 5–72 h. We also found elevated concentrations of larger ({\textgreater} 90 nm) particles in the UT, which consisted mostly of organic matter and nitrate and were very effective CCN. Our findings suggest a conceptual model, where production of new aerosol particles takes place in the continental UT from biogenic volatile organic material brought up by deep convection and converted to condensable species in the UT. Subsequently, downward mixing and transport of upper tropospheric aerosol can be a source of particles to the PBL, where they increase in size by the condensation of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) oxidation products. This may be an important source of aerosol particles for the Amazonian PBL, where aerosol nucleation and new particle formation have not been observed. We propose that this may have been the dominant process supplying secondary aerosol particles in the pristine atmosphere, making clouds the dominant control of both removal and production of atmospheric particles.},

	abstract = {Aerosol indirect effects have potentially large impacts on the Arctic Ocean surface energy budget, but model estimates of regional-scale aerosol indirect effects are highly uncertain and poorly validated by observations. Here we demonstrate a new way to quantitatively estimate aerosol indirect effects on a regional scale from remote sensing observations. In this study, we focus on nighttime, optically thin, predominantly liquid clouds. The method is based on differences in cloud physical and microphysical characteristics in carefully selected clean, average, and aerosol-impacted conditions. The cloud subset of focus covers just ∼ 5 \% of cloudy Arctic Ocean regions, warming the Arctic Ocean surface by ∼ 1–1.4 W m−2 regionally during polar night. However, within this cloud subset, aerosol and cloud conditions can be determined with high confidence using CALIPSO and CloudSat data and model output. This cloud subset is generally susceptible to aerosols, with a polar nighttime estimated maximum regionally integrated indirect cooling effect of ∼ −0.11 W m−2 at the Arctic sea ice surface (∼ 8 \% of the clean background cloud effect), excluding cloud fraction changes. Aerosol presence is related to reduced precipitation, cloud thickness, and radar reflectivity, and in some cases, an increased likelihood of cloud presence in the liquid phase. These observations are inconsistent with a glaciation indirect effect and are consistent with either a deactivation effect or less-efficient secondary ice formation related to smaller liquid cloud droplets. However, this cloud subset shows large differences in surface and meteorological forcing in shallow and higher-altitude clouds and between sea ice and open-ocean regions. For example, optically thin, predominantly liquid clouds are much more likely to overlay another cloud over the open ocean, which may reduce aerosol indirect effects on the surface. Also, shallow clouds over open ocean do not appear to respond to aerosols as strongly as clouds over stratified sea ice environments, indicating a larger influence of meteorological forcing over aerosol microphysics in these types of clouds over the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the formation of cloud droplets under pyro-convective conditions using a cloud parcel model with detailed spectral microphysics and with the κ-Köhler model approach for efficient and realistic description of the cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) activity of aerosol particles. Assuming a typical biomass burning aerosol size distribution (accumulation mode centred at 120 nm), we have calculated initial cloud droplet number concentrations (NCD) for a wide range of updraft velocities (w=0.25–20 m s−1) and aerosol particle number concentrations (NCN=200–105 cm−3) at the cloud base. Depending on the ratio between updraft velocity and particle number concentration (w/NCN), we found three distinctly different regimes of CCN activation and cloud droplet formation: (1) An aerosol-limited regime that is characterized by high w/NCN ratios ({\textgreater}≈10−3 m s−1 cm3), high maximum values of water vapour supersaturation (Smax{\textgreater}≈0.5\%), and high activated fractions of aerosol particles (NCN/NCN{\textgreater}≈90\%). In this regime NCD is directly proportional to NCN and practically independent of w. (2) An updraft-limited regime that is characterized by low w/NCN ratios (−4 m s−1 cm3), low maximum values of water vapour supersaturation (SmaxNCD/NCNNCD is directly proportional to w and practically independent of NCN. (3) An aerosol- and updraft-sensitive regime (transitional regime), which is characterized by parameter values in between the two other regimes and covers most of the conditions relevant for pyro-convection. In this regime NCD depends non-linearly on both NCN and w. In sensitivity studies we have tested the influence of aerosol particle size distribution and hygroscopicity on NCD. Within the range of effective hygroscopicity parameters that is characteristic for continental atmospheric aerosols (κ≈0.05–0.6), we found that NCD depends rather weakly on the actual value of κ. A compensation of changes in κ and Smax leads to an effective buffering of NCD. Only for aerosols with very low hygroscopicity (κ0.3) did the relative sensitivities ∂lnNCD/∂lnκ≈ (ΔNCD/NCD)/(Δκ/κ) exceed values of {\textasciitilde}0.2, indicating that a 50\% difference in κ would change NCD by more than 10\%. The influence of changing size distribution parameters was stronger than that of particle hygroscopicity. Nevertheless, similar regimes of CCN activation were observed in simulations with varying types of size distributions (polluted and pristine continental and marine aerosols with different proportions of nucleation, Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode particles). In general, the different regimes can be discriminated with regard to the relative sensitivities of NCD against w and NCN (∂lnNCD/∂lnw and ∂lnNCD/∂lnNCN). We propose to separate the different regimes by relative sensitivity ratios, (∂lnNCD/∂lnw)/(∂lnNCD/∂lnNCN) of 4:1 and 1:4, respectively. The results of this and related studies suggest that the variability of initial cloud droplet number concentration in convective clouds is mostly dominated by the variability of updraft velocity and aerosol particle number concentration in the accumulation and Aitken mode. Coarse mode particles and the variability of particle composition and hygroscopicity appear to play major roles only at low supersaturation in the updraft-limited regime of CCN activation (SmaxCitation: Reutter, P., Su, H., Trentmann, J., Simmel, M., Rose, D., Gunthe, S.

	abstract = {Five pockets of open cells (POCs) are studied using aircraft flights from the VOCALS Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx), conducted in October and November 2008 over the southeast Pacific Ocean. Satellite imagery from the geostationary satellite GOES-10 is used to distinguish POC areas, and measurements from the aircraft flights are used to compare aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and boundary layer conditions inside and outside of POCs. Conditions observed across individual POC cases are also compared. POCs are observed in boundary layers with a wide range of inversion heights (1250 to 1600 m) and surface wind speeds (5 to 11 m s−1) and show no remarkable difference from the observed surface and free-tropospheric conditions during the two months of the field campaign. In all cases, compared to the surrounding overcast region the POC boundary layer is more decoupled, supporting both thin stratiform and deeper cumulus clouds. Although cloud-base precipitation rates are higher in the POC than the overcast region in each case, a threshold precipitation rate that differentiates POC precipitation from overcast precipitation does not exist. Mean cloud-base precipitation rates in POCs can range from 1.7 to 5.8 mm d−1 across different POC cases. The occurrence of heavy drizzle ({\textgreater} 0 dBZ) lower in the boundary layer better differentiates POC precipitation from overcast precipitation, likely leading to the more active cold pool formation in POCs. Cloud droplet number concentration is at least a factor of 8 smaller in the POC clouds, and the ratio of drizzle water to cloud water in POC clouds is over an order of magnitude larger than that in overcast clouds, indicating an enhancement of collision–coalescence processes in POC clouds. Despite large variations in the accumulation-mode aerosol concentrations observed in the surrounding overcast region (65 to 324 cm−3), the accumulation-mode aerosol concentrations observed in the subcloud layer of all five POCs exhibit a much narrower range (24 to 40 cm−3), and cloud droplet concentrations within the cumulus updrafts originating in this layer reflect this limited variability. Above the POC subcloud layer exists an ultraclean layer with accumulation-mode aerosol concentrations −3, demonstrating that in-cloud collision–coalescence processes efficiently remove aerosols. The existence of the ultraclean layer also suggests that the major source of accumulation-mode aerosols, and hence of cloud condensation nuclei in POCs, is the ocean surface, while entrainment of free-tropospheric aerosols is weak. The measurements also suggest that at approximately 30 cm−3 a balance of surface source and coalescence scavenging sinks of accumulation-mode aerosols maintain the narrow range of observed subcloud aerosol concentrations.},

These vertical changes in sources and chemistry lead to systematic variation in aerosol composition as a function of potential temperature.

Gas transfer coefficients (k660) show a linear dependence on mean horizontal wind speed at wind speeds up to 11 m s−1. At higher wind speeds the relationship between k660 and wind speed weakens. At high winds, measured DMS fluxes were lower than predicted based on the linear relationship between wind speed and interfacial stress extrapolated from low to intermediate wind speeds. In contrast, the transfer coefficient for sensible heat did not exhibit this effect. The apparent suppression of air–sea gas flux at higher wind speeds appears to be related to sea state, as determined from shipboard wave measurements. These observations are consistent with the idea that long waves suppress near-surface water-side turbulence, and decrease interfacial gas transfer. This effect may be more easily observed for DMS than for less soluble gases, such as CO2, because the air–sea exchange of DMS is controlled by interfacial rather than bubble-mediated gas transfer under high wind speed conditions.},

	abstract = {Aerosol indirect effects continue to constitute one of the most important uncertainties for anthropogenic climate perturbations. Within the international AEROCOM initiative, the representation of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in ten different general circulation models (GCMs) is evaluated using three satellite datasets. The focus is on stratiform liquid water clouds since most GCMs do not include ice nucleation effects, and none of the model explicitly parameterises aerosol effects on convective clouds. We compute statistical relationships between aerosol optical depth (τa) and various cloud and radiation quantities in a manner that is consistent between the models and the satellite data. It is found that the model-simulated influence of aerosols on cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) compares relatively well to the satellite data at least over the ocean. The relationship between τa and liquid water path is simulated much too strongly by the models. This suggests that the implementation of the second aerosol indirect effect mainly in terms of an autoconversion parameterisation has to be revisited in the GCMs. A positive relationship between total cloud fraction (fcld) and τa as found in the satellite data is simulated by the majority of the models, albeit less strongly than that in the satellite data in most of them. In a discussion of the hypotheses proposed in the literature to explain the satellite-derived strong fcld–τa relationship, our results indicate that none can be identified as a unique explanation. Relationships similar to the ones found in satellite data between τa and cloud top temperature or outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) are simulated by only a few GCMs. The GCMs that simulate a negative OLR–τa relationship show a strong positive correlation between τa and fcld. The short-wave total aerosol radiative forcing as simulated by the GCMs is strongly influenced by the simulated anthropogenic fraction of τa, and parameterisation assumptions such as a lower bound on Nd. Nevertheless, the strengths of the statistical relationships are good predictors for the aerosol forcings in the models. An estimate of the total short-wave aerosol forcing inferred from the combination of these predictors for the modelled forcings with the satellite-derived statistical relationships yields a global annual mean value of −1.5±0.5 Wm−2. In an alternative approach, the radiative flux perturbation due to anthropogenic aerosols can be broken down into a component over the cloud-free portion of the globe (approximately the aerosol direct effect) and a component over the cloudy portion of the globe (approximately the aerosol indirect effect). An estimate obtained by scaling these simulated clear- and cloudy-sky forcings with estimates of anthropogenic τa and satellite-retrieved Nd–τa regression slopes, respectively, yields a global, annual-mean aerosol direct effect estimate of −0.4±0.2 Wm−2 and a cloudy-sky (aerosol indirect effect) estimate of −0.7±0.5 Wm−2, with a total estimate of −1.2±0.4 Wm−2.},

	abstract = {Heavy rainfall from convective clouds can lead to devastating flash flooding, and observations of aerosols and clouds are required to improve cloud parameterisations used in precipitation forecasts. We present measurements of boundary layer aerosol concentration, size, and composition from a series of research flights performed over the southwest peninsula of the UK during the COnvective Precipitation Experiment (COPE) of summer 2013. We place emphasis on periods of southwesterly winds, which locally are most conducive to convective cloud formation, when marine air from the Atlantic reached the peninsula. Accumulation-mode aerosol mass loadings were typically 2–3 µg m−3 (corrected to standard cubic metres at 1013.25 hPa and 273.15 K), the majority of which was sulfuric acid over the sea, or ammonium sulfate inland, as terrestrial ammonia sources neutralised the aerosol. The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations in these conditions were ∼  150–280 cm−3 at 0.1 \% and 400–500 cm−3 at 0.9 \% supersaturation (SST), which are in good agreement with previous Atlantic measurements, and the cloud drop concentrations at cloud base ranged from 100 to 500 cm−3. The concentration of CCN at 0.1 \% SST was well correlated with non-sea-salt sulfate, meaning marine sulfate formation was likely the main source of CCN. Marine organic aerosol (OA) had a similar mass spectrum to previous measurements of sea spray OA and was poorly correlated with CCN. In one case study that was significantly different to the rest, polluted anthropogenic emissions from the southern and central UK advected to the peninsula, with significant enhancements of OA, ammonium nitrate and sulfate, and black carbon. The CCN concentrations here were around 6 times higher than in the clean cases, and the cloud drop number concentrations were 3–4 times higher. Sources of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) were assessed by comparing different parameterisations used to predict INP concentrations, using measured aerosol concentrations as input. The parameterisations based on total aerosol produced INP concentrations that agreed within an order of magnitude with measured first ice concentrations at cloud temperatures as low as −12 °C. Composition-specific parameterisations for mineral dust, fluorescent particles, and sea spray OA were 3–4 orders of magnitude lower than the measured first ice concentrations, meaning a source of INPs was present that was not characterised by our measurements and/or one or more of the composition-specific parameterisations greatly underestimated INPs in this environment.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols from anthropogenic and natural sources reach the polar regions through long-range transport and affect the local radiation balance. Such transport is, however, poorly constrained in present-day global climate models, and few multi-model evaluations of polar anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing exist. Here we compare the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm from simulations with 16 global aerosol models from the AeroCom Phase II model intercomparison project with available observations at both poles. We show that the annual mean multi-model median is representative of the observations in Arctic, but that the intermodel spread is large. We also document the geographical distribution and seasonal cycle of the AOD for the individual aerosol species: black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel and biomass burning, sulfate, organic aerosols (OAs), dust, and sea-salt. For a subset of models that represent nitrate and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), we document the role of these aerosols at high latitudes.The seasonal dependence of natural and anthropogenic aerosols differs with natural aerosols peaking in winter (sea-salt) and spring (dust), whereas AOD from anthropogenic aerosols peaks in late spring and summer. The models produce a median annual mean AOD of 0.07 in the Arctic (defined here as north of 60° N). The models also predict a noteworthy aerosol transport to the Antarctic (south of 70° S) with a resulting AOD varying between 0.01 and 0.02. The models have estimated the shortwave anthropogenic radiative forcing contributions to the direct aerosol effect (DAE) associated with BC and OA from fossil fuel and biofuel (FF), sulfate, SOAs, nitrate, and biomass burning from BC and OA emissions combined. The Arctic modelled annual mean DAE is slightly negative (−0.12 W m−2), dominated by a positive BC FF DAE in spring and a negative sulfate DAE in summer. The Antarctic DAE is governed by BC FF. We perform sensitivity experiments with one of the AeroCom models (GISS modelE) to investigate how regional emissions of BC and sulfate and the lifetime of BC influence the Arctic and Antarctic AOD. A doubling of emissions in eastern Asia results in a 33 \% increase in Arctic AOD of BC. A doubling of the BC lifetime results in a 39 \% increase in Arctic AOD of BC. However, these radical changes still fall within the AeroCom model range.},

	abstract = {The Cloud Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), on board the CALIPSO platform, has measured profiles of total attenuated backscatter coefficient (level 1 products) since June 2006. CALIOP's level 2 products, such as the aerosol backscatter and extinction coefficient profiles, are retrieved using a complex succession of automated algorithms. The goal of this study is to help identify potential shortcomings in the CALIOP version 2 level 2 aerosol extinction product and to illustrate some of the motivation for the changes that have been introduced in the next version of CALIOP data (version 3, released in June 2010). To help illustrate the potential factors contributing to the uncertainty of the CALIOP aerosol extinction retrieval, we focus on a one-day, multi-instrument, multiplatform comparison study during the CALIPSO and Twilight Zone (CATZ) validation campaign on 4 August 2007. On that day, we observe a consistency in the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values recorded by four different instruments (i.e. space-borne MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS: 0.67 and POLarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectances, POLDER: 0.58, airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar, HSRL: 0.52 and ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork, AERONET: 0.48 to 0.73) while CALIOP AOD is a factor of two lower (0.32 at 532 nm). This case study illustrates the following potential sources of uncertainty in the CALIOP AOD: (i) CALIOP's low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) leading to the misclassification and/or lack of aerosol layer identification, especially close to the Earth's surface; (ii) the cloud contamination of CALIOP version 2 aerosol backscatter and extinction profiles; (iii) potentially erroneous assumptions of the aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio (Sa) used in CALIOP's extinction retrievals; and (iv) calibration coefficient biases in the CALIOP daytime attenuated backscatter coefficient profiles. The use of version 3 CALIOP extinction retrieval for our case study seems to partially fix factor (i) although the aerosol retrieved by CALIOP is still somewhat lower than the profile measured by HSRL; the cloud contamination (ii) appears to be corrected; no particular change is apparent in the observation-based CALIOP Sa value (iii). Our case study also showed very little difference in version 2 and version 3 CALIOP attenuated backscatter coefficient profiles, illustrating a minor change in the calibration scheme (iv).},

	abstract = {The AeroCom exercise diagnoses multi-component aerosol modules in global modeling. In an initial assessment simulated global distributions for mass and mid-visible aerosol optical thickness (aot) were compared among 20 different modules. Model diversity was also explored in the context of previous comparisons. For the component combined aot general agreement has improved for the annual global mean. At 0.11 to 0.14, simulated aot values are at the lower end of global averages suggested by remote sensing from ground (AERONET ca. 0.135) and space (satellite composite ca. 0.15). More detailed comparisons, however, reveal that larger differences in regional distribution and significant differences in compositional mixture remain. Of particular concern are large model diversities for contributions by dust and carbonaceous aerosol, because they lead to significant uncertainty in aerosol absorption (aab). Since aot and aab, both, influence the aerosol impact on the radiative energy-balance, the aerosol (direct) forcing uncertainty in modeling is larger than differences in aot might suggest. New diagnostic approaches are proposed to trace model differences in terms of aerosol processing and transport: These include the prescription of common input (e.g. amount, size and injection of aerosol component emissions) and the use of observational capabilities from ground (e.g. measurements networks) or space (e.g. correlations between aerosol and clouds).},

	abstract = {Aircraft measurements are presented from the 27/28 October 2008 case study of the VOCALS Regional Experiment (REx) over the remote subtropical southeast Pacific (18° S, 80° W). Data from two aircraft that took measurements approximately twelve hours apart but in the same advected airmass are used to document a remarkably sharp spatial transition in marine boundary layer (MBL), cloud, and aerosol structure across the boundary between a well-mixed MBL containing overcast closed mesoscale cellular stratocumulus, and a pocket of open cells (POC) with significantly lower cloud cover. Long ({\textasciitilde}190–250 km) straight and level flight legs at three levels in the marine boundary layer and one level in the lower free troposphere permit sampling of the closed cells, the POC, and a 20–30 km wide transition zone with distinctly different structure from the two airmasses on either side. The POC region consists of intermittent active and strongly precipitating cumulus clouds rising and detraining into patches of drizzling but quiescent stratiform cloud which is optically thin especially toward its edges. Mean cloud-base precipitation rates inside the POC are several mm d−1, but rates in the closed cell region are not greatly lower than this. This latter finding suggests that precipitation is not a sufficient condition for POC formation from overcast stratocumulus. Despite similar cloud-base precipitation rates in the POC and overcast region, much of the precipitation ({\textgreater}90\%) evaporates below cloud in the overcast region, while there is significant surface precipitation inside the POC. In the POC and transition region, although the majority of the condensate is in the form of drizzle, the integrated liquid water path is remarkably close to that expected for a moist adiabatic parcel rising from cloud base to top. The transition zone between the POC and the closed cells often consists of thick "boundary cell" clouds producing mean surface precipitation rates of 10–20 mm d−1, a divergent quasi-permanent cold/moist pool below cloud, a convergent inflow region at mid-levels in the MBL, and a divergent outflow near the top of the MBL. The stratiform clouds in the POC exist within an ultra-clean layer that is some 200–300 m thick. Aerosol concentrations (Na) measured by a PCASP in the diameter range 0.12–3.12 μm in the center of the ultra-clean layer are as low as 0.1–1 cm−3. This suggests that coalescence scavenging and sedimentation is extremely efficient, since Na in the subcloud layer, and droplet concentration Nd in the active cumuli are typically 20–60 cm−3. The droplet concentrations in the quiescent stratiform clouds are extremely low (typically 1–10 cm−3), and most of their liquid water is in the form of drizzle, which mainly evaporates before reaching the surface. The cloud droplet concentration in the overcast region decreases strongly as the transition region is approached, as do subcloud accumulation mode aerosol concentrations, suggesting that coalescence scavenging is impacting regions in the overcast region as well as inside the POC. Both flights show lower accumulation mode aerosol concentration in the subcloud layer of the POC (Na ∼ 30 cm−3) compared with the overcast region (Na ∼ 100 cm−3), but elevated (and mostly volatile) total aerosol concentrations are observed in the POC at all levels around 20–50 km from the transition zone, perhaps associated with some prior nucleation event. Despite the large differences in cloud and MBL structure across the POC-overcast boundary, the MBL depth is almost the same in the two regions, and increases in concert over the 12 h period between the flights.},

Under these low concentration conditions cloud droplets grow to drizzle sizes and fall, even in the absence of collisions and coalescence, thereby diminishing cloud water. Evidence from a case study suggests that interactions between aerosol, clouds and precipitation could be responsible for attaining the observed low aerosol concentrations.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric variations of carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction reflect changes in atmospheric transport and regional patterns of surface emission and uptake. Here we present a study of changes in the observed high northern latitude CO2 seasonal cycle. We report new estimates for changes in the phase and amplitude of the seasonal variations, indicative of biospheric changes, by spectrally decomposing multi-decadal records of surface CO2 mole fraction using a wavelet transform to isolate the changes in the observed seasonal cycle. We also perform similar analysis of the first derivative of CO2 mole fraction, ΔtCO2, that is a crude proxy for changes in CO2 flux. Using numerical experiments, we quantify the aliasing error associated with independently identifying trends in phase and peak uptake and release to be 10–25 \%, with the smallest biases in phase associated with the analysis of ΔtCO2. We report our analysis from Barrow, Alaska (BRW), during 1973–2013, which is representative of the broader Arctic region. We determine an amplitude trend of 0.09 ± 0.02 ppm yr-1, which is consistent with previous work. Using ΔtCO2 we determine estimates for the timing of the onset of net uptake and release of CO2 of −0.14 ± 0.14 and −0.25 ± 0.08 days yr-1 respectively and a corresponding net uptake period of −0.11 ± 0.16 days yr-1, which are significantly different to previously reported estimates. We find that the wavelet transform method has significant skill in characterizing changes in the peak uptake and release. We find a trend of 0.65 ± 0.34 \% yr-1 (p -1 (p 2 together with an invariant net carbon uptake period provides evidence that high northern latitude ecosystems are progressively taking up more carbon during spring and early summer.},

	abstract = {Though many global aerosols models prognose surface deposition, only a few models have been used to directly simulate the radiative effect from black carbon (BC) deposition to snow and sea ice. Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng g−1 for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng g−1 for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng g−1. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model–measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60–90° N) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07–0.25) W m−2 and 0.18 (0.06–0.28) W m−2 in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W m−2 for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.},

	abstract = {The NASA DC-8 aircraft characterized the aerosol properties, chemical composition, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations of the summertime Arctic during the 2008 NASA Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) campaign. Air masses characteristic of fresh and aged biomass burning, boreal forest, Arctic background, and anthropogenic industrial pollution were sampled. Observations were spatially extensive (50–85° N and 40–130° W) and exhibit significant variability in aerosol and CCN concentrations. The chemical composition was dominated by highly oxidized organics (66–94\% by volume), with a water-soluble mass fraction of more than 50\%. The aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, κ, ranged between κ = 0.08–0.32 for all air mass types. Industrial pollution had the lowest κ of 0.08 ± 0.01, while the Arctic background had the highest and most variable κ of 0.32 ± 0.21, resulting from a lower and more variable organic fraction. Both fresh and aged (long-range transported) biomass burning air masses exhibited remarkably similar κ (0.18 ± 0.13), consistent with observed rapid chemical and physical aging of smoke emissions in the atmosphere, even in the vicinity of fresh fires. The organic hygroscopicity (κorg) was parameterized by the volume fraction of water-soluble organic matter (εWSOM), with a κ = 0.12, such that κorg = 0.12εWSOM. Assuming bulk (size-independent) composition and including the κorg parameterization enabled CCN predictions to within 30\% accuracy for nearly all environments sampled. The only exception was for industrial pollution from Canadian oil sands exploration, where an external mixture and size-dependent composition was required. Aerosol mixing state assumptions (internal vs. external) in all other environments did not significantly affect CCN predictions; however, the external mixing assumption provided the best results, even though the available observations could not determine the true degree of external mixing and therefore may not always be representative of the environments sampled. No correlation was observed between κorg and O : C. A novel correction of the CCN instrument supersaturation for water vapor depletion, resulting from high concentrations of CCN, was also employed. This correction was especially important for fresh biomass burning plumes where concentrations exceeded 1.5×104 cm−3 and introduced supersaturation depletions of \&geq;25\%. Not accounting for supersaturation depletion in these high concentration environments would therefore bias CCN closure up to 25\% and inferred κ by up to 50\%.},

	abstract = {We use the GLOMAP global aerosol model evaluated against observations of surface particulate matter (PM2.5) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) to better understand the impacts of biomass burning on tropical aerosol over the period 2003 to 2011. Previous studies report a large underestimation of AOD over regions impacted by tropical biomass burning, scaling particulate emissions from fire by up to a factor of 6 to enable the models to simulate observed AOD. To explore the uncertainty in emissions we use three satellite-derived fire emission datasets (GFED3, GFAS1 and FINN1). In these datasets the tropics account for 66–84 \% of global particulate emissions from fire. With all emission datasets GLOMAP underestimates dry season PM2.5 concentrations in regions of high fire activity in South America and underestimates AOD over South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. When we assume an upper estimate of aerosol hygroscopicity, underestimation of AOD over tropical regions impacted by biomass burning is reduced relative to previous studies. Where coincident observations of surface PM2.5 and AOD are available we find a greater model underestimation of AOD than PM2.5, even when we assume an upper estimate of aerosol hygroscopicity. Increasing particulate emissions to improve simulation of AOD can therefore lead to overestimation of surface PM2.5 concentrations. We find that scaling FINN1 emissions by a factor of 1.5 prevents underestimation of AOD and surface PM2.5 in most tropical locations except Africa. GFAS1 requires emission scaling factor of 3.4 in most locations with the exception of equatorial Asia where a scaling factor of 1.5 is adequate. Scaling GFED3 emissions by a factor of 1.5 is sufficient in active deforestation regions of South America and equatorial Asia, but a larger scaling factor is required elsewhere. The model with GFED3 emissions poorly simulates observed seasonal variability in surface PM2.5 and AOD in regions where small fires dominate, providing independent evidence that GFED3 underestimates particulate emissions from small fires. Seasonal variability in both PM2.5 and AOD is better simulated by the model using FINN1 emissions. Detailed observations of aerosol properties over biomass burning regions are required to better constrain particulate emissions from fires.},

On 14 June 2006, the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) was deployed aboard the NASA Langley B-200 aircraft for the first of a series of 86 underflights of the CALIPSO satellite to provide validation measurements for the CALIOP data products. To better assess the range of conditions under which CALIOP data products are produced, these validation flights were conducted under both daytime and nighttime lighting conditions, in multiple seasons, and over a large range of latitudes and aerosol and cloud conditions. This paper presents a quantitative assessment of the CALIOP 532 nm calibration (through the 532 nm total attenuated backscatter) using internally calibrated airborne HSRL underflight data and is the most extensive study of CALIOP 532 nm calibration. Results show that HSRL and CALIOP 532 nm total attenuated backscatter agree on average within 2.7\% ± 2.1\% (CALIOP lower) at night and within 2.9\% ± 3.9\% (CALIOP lower) during the day, demonstrating the accuracy of the CALIOP 532 nm calibration algorithms. Additionally, comparisons with HSRL show consistency of the CALIOP calibration before and after the laser switch in 2009 as well as improvements in the daytime version 3.01 calibration scheme compared with the version 2 calibration scheme. Potential biases and uncertainties in the methodology relevant to validating satellite lidar measurements with an airborne lidar system are discussed and found to be less than 4.5\% ± 3.2\% for this validation effort with HSRL. Results from this study are also compared with prior assessments of the CALIOP 532 nm attenuated backscatter calibration.},

	abstract = {Absorbing aerosols (AAs) such as black carbon (BC) or dust absorb incoming solar radiation, perturb the temperature structure of the atmosphere, and influence cloud cover. Previous studies have described conditions under which AAs either increase or decrease cloud cover. The effect depends on several factors, including the altitude of the AA relative to the cloud and the cloud type. We attempt to categorize the effects into several likely regimes. Cloud cover is decreased if the AAs are embedded in the cloud layer. AAs below cloud may enhance convection and cloud cover. AAs above cloud top stabilize the underlying layer and tend to enhance stratocumulus clouds but may reduce cumulus clouds. AAs can also promote cloud cover in convergent regions as they enhance deep convection and low level convergence as it draws in moisture from ocean to land regions. Most global model studies indicate a regional variation in the cloud response but generally increased cloud cover over oceans and some land regions, with net increased low-level and/or reduced upper level cloud cover. The result is a net negative semi-direct effect feedback from the cloud response to AAs. In some of these climate model studies, the cooling effect of BC due to cloud changes is strong enough to essentially cancel the warming direct effects.},

Fresher pollution aerosol as encountered in Riverside, CA, and the ship channel in Houston, TX, cannot be represented without knowledge of more complex (size-resolved) composition. For aerosol that has experienced processing (Mexico City, Holme Moss (UK), Point Reyes (CA), and Chebogue Point (Canada)), CCN can be predicted within a factor of two assuming either externally or internally mixed soluble organics although these simplified compositions/mixing states might not represent the actual properties of ambient aerosol populations, in agreement with many previous CCN studies in the literature.

	abstract = {The Convective Cloud Field Model (CCFM) attempts to address some of the shortcomings of both the commonly used bulk mass-flux parameterisations and those using a prescribed spectrum of clouds. By considering the cloud spectrum as a competitive system in which cloud types interact through their environment in competition for convective available potential energy (CAPE), the spectrum is able to respond dynamically to changes in the environment. An explicit Lagrangian entraining plume model for each cloud type allows for the representation of convective-cloud microphysics, paving the way for the study of aerosol–convection interactions at the global scale where their impact remains highly uncertain. In this paper, we introduce a new treatment of convective triggering, extending the entraining plume model below cloud base to explicitly represent the unsaturated thermals which initiate convection. This allows for a realistic vertical velocity to develop at cloud base, so that the cloud microphysics can begin with physically based activation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). We evaluate this new version of CCFM in the context of the global model ECHAM6–HAM, comparing its performance to the standard Tiedtke–Nordeng parameterisation used in that model. We find that the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation is improved, both against a climatology from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and also against diurnal cycles from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) with a reduced tendency for precipitation to peak too early in the afternoon. Cloud cover is quite sensitive to the vertical level from which the dry convection is initiated, but when this is chosen appropriately the cloud cover compares well with that from Tiedtke–Nordeng. CCFM can thus perform as well as, or better than, the standard scheme while providing additional capabilities to represent convective-cloud microphysics and dynamic cloud morphology at the global scale.},

The models are compared to extensive observations along a line at 20° S extending westward from the South American coast. Most of the models simulate cloud and aerosol characteristics and gradients across the region that are recognizably similar to observations, despite the complex interaction of processes involved in the problem, many of which are parameterized or poorly resolved. Some models simulate the regional low cloud cover well, though many models underestimate MBL (marine boundary layer) depth near the coast. Most models qualitatively simulate the observed offshore gradients of SO2, sulfate aerosol, CCN (cloud condensation nuclei) concentration in the MBL as well as differences in concentration between the MBL and the free troposphere. Most models also qualitatively capture the decrease in cloud droplet number away from the coast. However, there are large quantitative intermodel differences in both means and gradients of these quantities. Many models are able to represent episodic offshore increases in cloud droplet number and aerosol concentrations associated with periods of offshore flow. Most models underestimate CCN (at 0.1\% supersaturation) in the MBL and free troposphere. The GCMs also have difficulty simulating coastal gradients in CCN and cloud droplet number concentration near the coast. The overall performance of the models demonstrates their potential utility in simulating aerosol–cloud interactions in the MBL, though quantitative estimation of aerosol–cloud interactions and aerosol indirect effects of MBL clouds with these models remains uncertain.},

However, carbonaceous combustion aerosol can also act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) so they also cool the climate by increasing cloud albedo. The net radiative effect of carbonaceous combustion aerosol is uncertain because their contribution to CCN has not been evaluated on the global scale. By combining extensive observations of CCN concentrations with the GLOMAP global aerosol model, we find that the model is biased low (normalised mean bias = −77 \%) unless carbonaceous combustion aerosol act as CCN. We show that carbonaceous combustion aerosol accounts for more than half (52–64 \%) of global CCN with the range due to uncertainty in the emitted size distribution of carbonaceous combustion particles. The model predicts that wildfire and pollution (fossil fuel and biofuel) carbonaceous combustion aerosol causes a global mean cloud albedo aerosol indirect effect of −0.34 W m−2, with stronger cooling if we assume smaller particle emission size. We calculate that carbonaceous combustion aerosol from pollution sources cause a global mean aerosol indirect effect of −0.23 W m−2. The small size of carbonaceous combustion particles from fossil fuel sources means that whilst pollution sources account for only one-third of the emitted mass they cause two-thirds of the cloud albedo aerosol indirect effect that is due to carbonaceous combustion aerosol. This cooling effect must be accounted for, along with other cloud effects not studied here, to ensure that black carbon emissions controls that reduce the high number concentrations of fossil fuel particles have the desired net effect on climate.},

It is important to separate these two sources because they respond in different ways to gas and particle emission control strategies and environmental changes. Here, we use a global aerosol microphysics model to quantify the contribution of primary and nucleated particles to global CCN. The model considers primary emissions of sea spray, sulfate and carbonaceous particles, and nucleation processes appropriate for the free troposphere and boundary layer. We estimate that 45\% of global low-level cloud CCN at 0.2\% supersaturation are secondary aerosol derived from nucleation (ranging between 31–49\% taking into account uncertainties in primary emissions and nucleation rates), with the remainder from primary emissions. The model suggests that 35\% of CCN (0.2\%) in global low-level clouds were created in the free and upper troposphere. In the marine boundary layer 55\% of CCN (0.2\%) are from nucleation, with 45\% entrained from the free troposphere and 10\% nucleated directly in the boundary layer. Combinations of model runs show that primary and nucleated CCN are non-linearly coupled. In particular, boundary layer nucleated CCN are strongly suppressed by both primary emissions and entrainment of particles nucleated in the free troposphere. Elimination of all primary emissions reduces global CCN (0.2\%) by only 20\% and elimination of upper tropospheric nucleation reduces CCN (0.2\%) by only 12\% because of the increased contribution from boundary layer nucleation.},

	abstract = {Many of the next generation of global climate models will include aerosol schemes which explicitly simulate the microphysical processes that determine the particle size distribution. These models enable aerosol optical properties and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations to be determined by fundamental aerosol processes, which should lead to a more physically based simulation of aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcings. This study examines the global variation in particle size distribution simulated by 12 global aerosol microphysics models to quantify model diversity and to identify any common biases against observations. Evaluation against size distribution measurements from a new European network of aerosol supersites shows that the mean model agrees quite well with the observations at many sites on the annual mean, but there are some seasonal biases common to many sites. In particular, at many of these European sites, the accumulation mode number concentration is biased low during winter and Aitken mode concentrations tend to be overestimated in winter and underestimated in summer. At high northern latitudes, the models strongly underpredict Aitken and accumulation particle concentrations compared to the measurements, consistent with previous studies that have highlighted the poor performance of global aerosol models in the Arctic. In the marine boundary layer, the models capture the observed meridional variation in the size distribution, which is dominated by the Aitken mode at high latitudes, with an increasing concentration of accumulation particles with decreasing latitude. Considering vertical profiles, the models reproduce the observed peak in total particle concentrations in the upper troposphere due to new particle formation, although modelled peak concentrations tend to be biased high over Europe. Overall, the multi-model-mean data set simulates the global variation of the particle size distribution with a good degree of skill, suggesting that most of the individual global aerosol microphysics models are performing well, although the large model diversity indicates that some models are in poor agreement with the observations. Further work is required to better constrain size-resolved primary and secondary particle number sources, and an improved understanding of nucleation and growth (e.g. the role of nitrate and secondary organics) will improve the fidelity of simulated particle size distributions.},

	abstract = {Aerosol–cloud interactions continue to constitute a major source of uncertainty for the estimate of climate radiative forcing. The variation of aerosol indirect effects (AIE) in climate models is investigated across different dynamical regimes, determined by monthly mean 500 hPa vertical pressure velocity (ω500), lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and large-scale surface precipitation rate derived from several global climate models (GCMs), with a focus on liquid water path (LWP) response to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. The LWP sensitivity to aerosol perturbation within dynamic regimes is found to exhibit a large spread among these GCMs. It is in regimes of strong large-scale ascent (ω500  {\textless}  −25 hPa day−1) and low clouds (stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus) where the models differ most. Shortwave aerosol indirect forcing is also found to differ significantly among different regimes. Shortwave aerosol indirect forcing in ascending regimes is close to that in subsidence regimes, which indicates that regimes with strong large-scale ascent are as important as stratocumulus regimes in studying AIE. It is further shown that shortwave aerosol indirect forcing over regions with high monthly large-scale surface precipitation rate ({\textgreater} 0.1 mm day−1) contributes the most to the total aerosol indirect forcing (from 64 to nearly 100 \%). Results show that the uncertainty in AIE is even larger within specific dynamical regimes compared to the uncertainty in its global mean values, pointing to the need to reduce the uncertainty in AIE in different dynamical regimes.},

We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative‐convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large‐scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends realistically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near‐equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number density, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in relative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near‐equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized precipitating cumulus cloud field is small. The trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative‐convective equilibrium Clear sky radiative effects accelerate the adjustment to equilibrium More cloud droplets lead to deeper and drier cloud layers and hence less cloud},

These desired properties are observables, such as the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere, the global mean temperature, sea ice, clouds and wind fields. The tuning is typically performed by adjusting uncertain, or even non-observable, parameters related to processes not explicitly represented at the model grid resolution. The practice of climate model tuning has seen an increasing level of attention because key model properties, such as climate sensitivity, have been shown to depend on frequently used tuning parameters. Here we provide insights into how climate model tuning is practically done in the case of closing the radiation balance and adjusting the global mean temperature for the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). We demonstrate that considerable ambiguity exists in the choice of parameters, and present and compare three alternatively tuned, yet plausible configurations of the climate model.

	abstract = {Modal aerosol dynamics (MAD) models represent an evolving aerosol as a superposition of individual modes, which represent distinct populations of particles. Physical processes cause the formation and growth of distinct modes, and when two modes move into proximity to each other, they may become indistinguishable. Under such conditions, the number of distinct modes can be reduced by merging two indistinguishable modes into a single mode. Also, in MAD models, as modes grow they must be continually remapped into mode indices that correspond to their position in size space. Therefore, nucleated particles that begin as Mode 1 particles, may grow to eventually become Mode 2, 3, or 4 particles.In this paper, a Dynamic Mode Manager (DMM) is described for use with MAD models, which is used to determine when two modes can be merged, to control the merging rate of multiple modes, and to map individual modes into mode indices corresponding to their position in size space. The DMM calculates the flux of moments from one mode into another, and permits the complete transfer of one mode into another through this intermodal flux. The moment flux is calculated based on the relative motion of two modes towards each other, and accounts for the effect of all aerosol processes on the particle size distribution. The conceptual formulation, theoretical derivation of the governing equations, and three examples of the performance of the DMM are presented.},

Preliminary results of atmospheric measurements are given. This device produces a CCN spectrum over the entire useful range of interest for cloud physics (0.01\% to 1\% supersaturation). More than 40 channels of resolution over this range are simultaneously provided. Data can be collected on a continuous basis for integration times as short as 2 seconds.

Recent studies have found that the treatment of precipitation efficiency in deep convective clouds – specifically the conversion rate from cloud condensate to rain (Cp) – may contribute to the large inter-model spread. It is common for convective parameterization in climate models to carry a constant Cp, though its values are model and resolution dependent. In this study, we investigate how introducing a potential iris feedback, the cloud-climate feedback introduced by parameterizing Cp to increase with surface temperature, affects future climate simulations within a slab-ocean configuration of the Community Earth System Model. Progressively stronger dependencies of Cp on temperature unexpectedly increases the equilibrium climate sensitivity monotonically from 3.8K to up to 4.6K. This positive iris feedback puzzle, in which reduced cirrus clouds increases surface temperature, is attributed to changes in the opacity of convectively detrained cirrus. Cirrus clouds reduced largely in ice content and marginally in horizontal coverage, and thus the positive shortwave cloud radiative feedback dominates. The sign of the iris feedback is robust across different cloud macrophysics schemes, which control horizontal cloud cover associated with detrained ice. These results suggest a potentially strong but highly uncertain connection between convective precipitation, detrained anvil cirrus, and the high cloud feedback in a climate forced by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.},

Large intermodel differences in the lapse rate feedback are observed and shown to be associated with differing regional patterns of surface warming. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the vertical changes in temperature and water vapor are tightly coupled in all models and, importantly, demonstrate that intermodel differences in the sum of lapse rate and water vapor feedbacks are small.

The degree to which either of the two factors contributed to EW and MC, or both, is still debated. Using a two-box impulse response model, we demonstrate that multidecadal ocean variability was unlikely to be the driver of observed changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST) after 1850 A.D. Instead, virtually all (97-98\%) of the global low-frequency variability ({\textgreater} 30 years) can be explained by external forcing. We find similarly high percentages of explained variance for inter-hemispheric and land-ocean temperature evolution. Three key aspects are identified which underpin the conclusion of this new study: inhomogeneous anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER), biases in the instrumental sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, and inadequate representation of the response to varying forcing factors. Once the spatially heterogeneous nature of AER is accounted for, the MC period is reconcilable with external drivers. SST biases and imprecise forcing responses explain the putative disagreement between models and observations during the EW period. As a consequence, Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) is found to be primarily controlled by external forcing too. Future attribution studies should account for these important factors when discriminating between externally-forced and internallygenerated influences on climate. We argue that AMV must not be used as a regressor and suggest a revised AMV index instead (North Atlantic Variability Index; NAVI). Our associated best estimate for the transient climate response (TCR) is 1.57 K (±0.70 at the 5-95\% confidence level).},

Accordingly, a new formulation of the energetics of the atmosphere is laid out with a view to advancing diagnostic studies of the Earth’s energy budget and flows. It is utilized to produce assessments of the vertically-integrated divergences in both the atmosphere and ocean. Careful conservation of mass is required, with special attention to the hydrological cycle and redistribution of mass associated with precipitation and evaporation, and a new method for ensuring this is developed. It guarantees that the atmospheric divergence is associated with moisture and precipitation, unlike previous methods. A new term, identified as associated with the enthalpy of precipitation, is included in a preliminary way. It is sensitive to the formulation, and use of temperature in degrees Celsius instead of Kelvin greatly reduces errors and produces the extra term with values up to about ±5 W m-2. New results for 2000 to 2016 are presented for the vertical mean and annual mean diabatic atmospheric heating, atmospheric moistening, and total atmospheric energy divergence. Results for the atmospheric divergence are combined with top-of-atmosphere radiation observations to deduce total surface energy fluxes. Along with estimates of changes in ocean heat content, the Atlantic Ocean meridional heat transports are re-computed for March 2000 through 2013. The new results are compared with previous estimates and an assessment is made of the effects of the new mass balance, change in temperature scale, and the extra precipitation enthalpy term.},

A three-mode representation of the aerosol in version 5.1 of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5.1) yields global annual mean radiative forcing estimates for each of these forcing mechanisms that are within 0.1 W m−2 of estimates using a more complex seven-mode representation that distinguishes between fresh and aged black carbon and primary organic matter. Simulating fresh black carbon particles separately from internally mixed accumulation mode particles is found to be important only near fossil fuel sources. In addition to the usual large indirect effect on solar radiation, this study finds an unexpectedly large positive longwave indirect effect (because of enhanced cirrus produced by homogenous nucleation of ice crystals on anthropogenic sulfate), small shortwave and longwave semidirect effects, and a small direct effect (because of cancelation and interactions of direct effects of black carbon and sulfate). Differences between the three-mode and seven-mode versions are significantly larger (up to 0.2 W m−2) when the hygroscopicity of primary organic matter is decreased from 0.1 to 0 and transfer of the primary carbonaceous aerosol to the accumulation mode in the seven-mode version requires more hygroscopic material coating the primary particles.

	abstract = {In this work we demonstrate a method to derive the concentration of aerosol components from the spectral measurements of AOD (aerosol optical depth) and single scattering albedo along with their size distribution and extinction profile available from AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) and MPLNET (Micro-pulse Lidar Network) stations. The technique involves finding the best combination of aerosol concentration by minimizing differences between measured and calculated values of aerosol parameters such as AOD, single scattering albedo, and size distribution. We applied this technique over selected sites in three different regions of the United States (West coast, Great Plains, and North-East). Our results are then compared with the measured concentration of aerosol components available from IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) and EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) network, as well as two different versions of the GFDL (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) General Circulation Model AM2 with online and offline aerosols. In general, concentrations retrieved by our technique compare well with the ground-based measurements, but there are some discrepancies possibly due to the inherent differences in temporal and spatial scales of data averaging or some of the assumptions made in our study. Over continental North America, the online version of AM2 appears to overestimate sulfate concentration approximately by a factor of two and underestimate organic carbon by nearly the same amount. Results of our sensitivity study show that the errors in the retrieval of black carbon and sulfate concentrations could be as high as 100\% when there is a large bias of ∼0.05 in the reference values of single scattering albedo under high AOD (≥0.5 at 0.44 μm) conditions. Knowledge on the vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial for an accurate retrieval of surface concentration of aerosols. We also determine the composition and concentration of elevated aerosol layers using this technique.},

	abstract = {If the aerosol composition and size distribution below cloud are uniform, the vertical profile of cloud condensation nuclei concentration can be retrieved entirely from surface measurements of CCN concentration and particle humidification function and surface-based retrievals of relative humidity and aerosol extinction or backscatter. This provides the potential for long-term measurements of CCN concentrations near cloud base. We have used a combination of aircraft, surface in situ, and surface remote sensing measurements to test various aspects of the retrieval scheme. Our analysis leads us to the following conclusions. The retrieval works better for supersaturations of 0.1\% than for 1\% because CCN concentrations at 0.1\% are controlled by the same particles that control extinction and backscatter. If in situ measurements of extinction are used, the retrieval explains a majority of the CCN variance at high supersaturation for at least two and perhaps five of the eight flights examined. The retrieval of the vertical profile of the humidification factor is not the major limitation of the CCN retrieval scheme. Vertical structure in the aerosol size distribution and composition is the dominant source of error in the CCN retrieval, but this vertical structure is difficult to measure from remote sensing at visible wavelengths.},

	abstract = {Most estimates of the global mean indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosol on the Earth's energy balance are from simulations by global models of the aerosol lifecycle coupled with global models of clouds and the hydrologic cycle. Extremely simple models have been developed for integrated assessment models, but lack the flexibility to distinguish between primary and secondary sources of aerosol. Here a simple but more physically based model expresses the aerosol indirect effect (AIE) using analytic representations of cloud and aerosol distributions and processes. Although the simple model is able to produce estimates of AIEs that are comparable to those from some global aerosol models using the same global mean aerosol properties, the estimates by the simple model are sensitive to preindustrial cloud condensation nuclei concentration, preindustrial accumulation mode radius, width of the accumulation mode, size of primary particles, cloud thickness, primary and secondary anthropogenic emissions, the fraction of the secondary anthropogenic emissions that accumulates on the coarse mode, the fraction of the secondary mass that forms new particles, and the sensitivity of liquid water path to droplet number concentration. Estimates of present-day AIEs as low as −5 W m−2 and as high as −0.3 W m−2 are obtained for plausible sets of parameter values. Estimates are surprisingly linear in emissions. The estimates depend on parameter values in ways that are consistent with results from detailed global aerosol-climate simulation models, which adds to understanding of the dependence on AIE uncertainty on uncertainty in parameter values.},

	abstract = {Tropical convection has been observed to contain three cloud modes, the middle of which is cumulus congestus clouds. Congestus clouds act to moisten the tropical atmosphere, may be mixed-phase, and on occasion surpass the freezing level inversion from where they may develop into deeper convection. This study investigates the impacts of enhanced aerosol concentrations on the growth of congestus clouds produced in idealized cloud-resolving model simulations run under a state of radiative convective equilibrium (RCE). High-resolution, long-duration simulations were completed using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). Aerosol concentrations between 2 and 4 km above ground level were varied from clean to polluted conditions in order to represent the advection of Saharan dust over the Atlantic Ocean. The congestus populations within each aerosol simulation are statistically analyzed using 10 days of model output after the simulation reaches RCE. Results indicate that congestus in more polluted conditions produce greater amounts of cloud water and ice mass, enhanced updraft strengths, and an increase in the number of congestus cloud tops that extend above the freezing level. Enhanced vapor depositional growth on the populations of more numerous, smaller cloud droplets in the polluted conditions, and the subsequent increase in latent heat release in the warm phase regions of the cloud, is found to be important factors in convective invigoration of these cloud systems. Aerosol feedbacks associated with cold pools and condensate loading also influence the updraft strength and act in opposition to the warm phase invigoration processes.},

	abstract = {Assessing the accuracy of the aerosol-above-cloud (AAC) properties derived by CALIOP (the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) is challenged by the shortage of accurate global validation measurements. We have used measurements of aerosol vertical profiles from the NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-1) in 86 CALIOP-coincident flights to evaluate CALIOP AAC detection, classification, and retrieval. Our study shows that CALIOP detects {\textasciitilde}23\% of the HSRL-detected AAC. According to our CALIOP-HSRL data set, the majority of AAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are {\textless} 0.1 at 532 nm over North America. Our analyses show that the standard CALIOP retrieval algorithm substantially underestimates the occurrence frequency of AAC when optical depths are less than {\textasciitilde}0.02. Those aerosols with low AOD values can still have a consequent radiative forcing effect depending on the underlying cloud cover and overlying aerosol absorption properties. We find essentially no correlation between CALIOP and HSRL AAC AOD (R2 = 0.27 and N = 151). We show that the CALIOP underestimation of AAC is mostly due to tenuous aerosol layers with backscatter less than the CALIOP detection threshold. The application of an alternate CALIOP AAC retrieval method (depolarization ratio) to our data set yields very few coincident cases. We stress the need for more extensive suborbital CALIOP validation campaigns to acquire a process-level understanding of AAC implications and further evaluate CALIOP's AAC detection and retrieval capability, especially over the ocean and in different parts of the world where AAC are more frequently observed and show higher values of AOD.},

It is essential to examine the coherency between space- and ground-measured aerosol parameters in representing aerosol spatial and temporal variability, especially in the climate forcing and model validation context. In this paper, we introduce Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA), also known as Singular Value Decomposition analysis as an effective way to compare correlated aerosol spatial and temporal patterns between satellite measurements and AERONET data. This technique not only successfully extracts the variability of major aerosol regimes but also allows the simultaneous examination of the aerosol variability both spatially and temporally. More importantly, it well accommodates the sparsely distributed AERONET data, for which other spectral decomposition methods, such as Principal Component Analysis, do not yield satisfactory results. The comparison shows overall good agreement between MODIS/MISR and AERONET AOD variability. The correlations between the first three modes of MCA results for both MODIS/AERONET and MISR/AERONET are above 0.8 for the full data set and above 0.75 for the AOD anomaly data. The correlations between MODIS and MISR modes are also quite high ({\textgreater} 0.9). We also examine the extent of spatial agreement between satellite and AERONET AOD data at the selected stations. Some sites with disagreements in the MCA results, such as Kanpur, also have low spatial coherency. This should be associated partly with high AOD spatial variability and partly with uncertainties in satellite retrievals due to the seasonally varying aerosol types and surface properties.},

The models and satellite observations are compared in the form of the statistics obtained from combined analysis of multiple-satellite observables that probe signatures of the cloud-to-precipitation transition process. One common problem identified among these models is the too-frequent occurrence of warm precipitation. The precipitation is found to form when the cloud particle size and the liquid water path (LWP) are both much smaller than those in observations. The too-efficient formation of precipitation is found to be compensated for by errors of cloud microphysical properties, such as underestimated cloud particle size and LWP, to an extent that varies among the models. However, this does not completely cancel the precipitation formation bias. Robust errors are also found in the evolution of cloud microphysical properties from nonprecipitating to drizzling and then to raining clouds in some GCMs, implying unrealistic interaction between precipitation and cloud water. Nevertheless, auspicious information is found for future improvement of warm precipitation representations: the adoption of more realistic autoconversion scheme in the high-resolution model improves the triggering of precipitation, and the introduction of a sophisticated subgrid variability scheme in a traditional model improves the simulated precipitation frequency over subtropical eastern ocean. However, deterioration in other warm precipitation characteristics is also found accompanying these improvements, implying the multisource nature of warm precipitation biases in GCMs.},

Ship‐based retrievals of cloud optical depth (τ) from a Sun photometer and liquid water path (LWP) from a microwave radiometer were combined to derive cloud droplet number concentration Nd and compute a cloud‐aerosol interaction (ACI) metric defined as ACICCN = ∂ ln(Nd)/∂ ln(CCN), with CCN denoting the cloud condensation nuclei concentration measured at 0.4\% (CCN0.4) and 0.3\% (CCN0.3) supersaturation. Analysis of CCN0.4, accumulation mode aerosol concentration (Na), and extinction coefficient (σext) indicates that Na and σext can be used as CCN0.4 proxies for estimating ACI. ACICCN derived from 10 min averaged Nd and CCN0.4 and CCN0.3, and CCN0.4 regressions using Na and σext, produce high ACICCN: near 1.0, that is, a fractional change in aerosols is associated with an equivalent fractional change in Nd. ACICCN computed in deep boundary layers was small (ACICCN = 0.60), indicating that surface aerosol measurements inadequately represent the aerosol variability below clouds. Satellite cloud retrievals from MODerate‐resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and GOES‐15 data were compared against ship‐based retrievals and further analyzed to compute a satellite‐based ACICCN. Satellite data correlated well with their ship‐based counterparts with linear correlation coefficients equal to or greater than 0.78. Combined satellite Nd and ship‐based CCN0.4 and Na yielded a maximum ACICCN = 0.88–0.92, a value slightly less than the ship‐based ACICCN, but still consistent with aircraft‐based studies in the eastern Pacific. Satellite and ship‐based remote sensing cloud retrievals are used to calculate the aerosol‐cloud covariability in the NE Pacific CCN, accumulation mode aerosol, and extinction coefficient yield consistently high covariability, near the physical upper limit Computed aerosol‐cloud interaction is consistent with aircraft studies in the eastern Pacific, especially for well‐mixed boundary layers},

	abstract = {Estimating the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS; the equilibrium warming in response to a doubling of CO2) from observations is one of the big problems in climate science. Using observations of interannual climate variations covering the period 2000 to 2017 and a model‐derived relationship between interannual variations and forced climate change, we estimate that ECS is likely 2.4–4.6 K (17–83\% confidence interval), with a mode and median value of 2.9 and 3.3 K, respectively. This analysis provides no support for low values of ECS (below 2 K) suggested by other analyses. The main uncertainty in our estimate is not observational uncertainty but rather uncertainty in converting observations of short term, mainly unforced climate variability to an estimate of the response of the climate system to long‐term forced warming. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the amount of warming resulting from doubling carbon dioxide. It is one of the important metrics in climate science because it is a primary determinant of how much warming we will experience in the future. Despite decades of work, this quantity remains uncertain: the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report stated a range for ECS of 1.5–4.5 °C. Using observations of interannual climate variations covering the period 2000 to 2017, we estimate that ECS is likely 2.4–4.6 K. Thus, our analysis provides no support for the bottom of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's range.

Only SeaWiFS data over land have slightly different EOF patterns. Globally, the first two EOF modes show annual cycles and are mainly related to Sahara dust in the northern hemisphere and biomass burning in the southern hemisphere, respectively. After removing the mean seasonal cycle from the data, major aerosol sources, including biomass burning in South America and dust in West Africa, are revealed in the dominant modes due to the different interannual variability of aerosol emissions. The enhancement of biomass burning associated with El Niño over Indonesia and central South America is also captured with the EOF technique.},

The model-measurement comparison is made within the context of how well the TRACE-P observations represent the springtime chemistry and ozone distributions over eastern Asia and the western Pacific in March 2001 and uses the four-dimensional (4-D) extended domain from the model to provide unbiased statistics. A key question is whether the limited sampling density or mission strategy led to a statistically biased sample. To address this question, we examine a diverse range of statistical analyses of the observations of CO and O3. The middle percentiles of the cumulative probability functions for CO in the free troposphere are representative (and reproduced by the CTM), but those in the boundary layer are not. The frequency of low-CO, stratospheric influence is well matched along flight tracks but is atypical of the extended domain. The percentiles of the latitude-by-height distribution of lidar O3 show how the CTM reproduces the nonrepresentative clumpy nature of the observations but has too low a tropopause about the jet region (30–35N). Adaptive kernel estimation of the 2-D probability density of O3-CO correlations shows a very good simulation of two different chemical regimes (stratospheric and polluted) that is quite different from the extended domain but also highlights the failure to predict CO {\textgreater} 400 ppb. Empirical orthogonal function analysis of the O3 vertical profiles shows how six EOFs can effectively describe the 4-D structures of O3 over this entire domain. The latitude-by-longitude maps of the principal components provide an excellent test of the CTM simulation along flight tracks and clearly show the unique sampling of O3 events by the TRACE-P flights. In many cases the ability of the model to simulate the nonrepresentative observations implies a clear skill in matching the unique meteorological and chemical features of the region.},

We evaluated the simulations of long-range transport of BB aerosol by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) and four other global aerosol models over the complete South African-Atlantic region using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations to find any distinguishing or common model biases. Models, in general, captured the vertical distribution of aerosol over land but exhibited some common features after long-range transport of smoke plumes that were distinct from that of CALIOP. Most importantly, the model-simulated BB aerosol plumes quickly descend to lower levels just off the western coast of the continent, while CALIOP data suggest that smoke plumes continue their horizontal transport at elevated levels above the marine boundary layer. This is crucial because the sign of simulated aerosol semidirect effect can change depending on whether the bulk of the absorbing aerosols is present within or above the cloud levels in a model. The levels to which the aerosol plumes get subsided and the steepness of their descent vary amongst the models and amongst the different subregions of the domain. Investigations into possible causes of differences between GEOS-5 and CALIOP aerosol transport over the ocean revealed a minimal role of aerosol removal process representation in the model as opposed to model dynamics.},

Number‐size distributions N(Dp) from 3 to 800 nm diameter and the hygroscopic properties of the aerosol in the 30 to 300 nm diameter range (which contains most of the CCN active at 0.5\%) were measured concurrently at the same location. This data set provides a basis to compare measured and modeled CCN concentrations. A critical particle diameter that would form cloud droplets at 0.5\% supersaturation was derived from the hygroscopic growth data including consideration of the hydration of the size distribution measurement. This empirically derived diameter incorporates the effects of soluble and insoluble mass as well as an effective van't Hoff factor and surface tension as described by Köhler theory for heterogeneous nucleation of cloud droplets. The size distributions were integrated for diameters greater than the critical value and compared to the directly measured CCN concentrations. The modeled CCN concentration was 95 cm−3 during baseline sector periods and 128 cm−3 overall. This was about 20\% greater than the directly measured CCN concentration and well correlated (R2 = 0.7) with measured CCN. Two thirds of the CCN at 0.5\% supersaturation derive from an accumulation mode (80 nm {\textless} Dp {\textless} 200 nm); with one sixth from each of the other two modes, a larger mode (Dp {\textgreater} 200 nm) and the Aitken mode (Dp {\textless} 80 nm).

	abstract = {Current climate models generally underpredict the surface concentration of black carbon (BC) in the Arctic due to the uncertainties associated with emissions, transport, and removal. This bias is also present in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 (CAM5). In this study, we investigate the uncertainty of Arctic BC due to transport processes simulated by CAM5 by configuring the model to run in an “off-line mode” in which the large-scale circulation features are prescribed. We compare the simulated BC transport when the off-line model is driven by the meteorology predicted by the standard free-running CAM5 with simulations where the meteorology is constrained to agree with reanalysis products. Some circulation biases are apparent: the free-running CAM5 produces about 50\% less transient eddy transport of BC than the reanalysis-driven simulations, which may be attributed to the coarse model resolution insufficient to represent eddies. Our analysis shows that the free-running CAM5 reasonably captures the essence of the Arctic Oscillation (AO), but some discernable differences in the spatial pattern of the AO between the free-running CAM5 and the reanalysis-driven simulations result in significantly different AO modulation of BC transport over northeast Asia and eastern Europe. Nevertheless, we find that the overall climatological circulation patterns simulated by the free-running CAM5 generally resemble those from the reanalysis products, and BC transport is very similar in both simulation sets. Therefore, the simulated circulation features regulating the long-range BC transport are unlikely the most important cause of the large underprediction of surface BC concentration in the Arctic.},

The key innovation is an efficient set of parallel software tools designed to leverage the inherited hybrid parallelism in distributed-memory clusters of multi-core machines. The performance of the toolbox is illustrated through networks derived from sea surface height (SSH) data of a global high-resolution ocean model. Less than 8 min are needed on 90 Intel Xeon E5-4650 processors to reconstruct a climate network including the preprocessing and the correlation of 3 × 105 SSH time series, resulting in a weighted graph with the same number of vertices and about 3.2 × 108 edges. In less than 14 min on 30 processors, the resulted graph's degree centrality, strength, connected components, eigenvector centrality, entropy and clustering coefficient metrics were obtained. These results indicate that a complete cycle to construct and analyze a large-scale climate network is available under 22 min Par@Graph therefore facilitates the application of climate network analysis on high-resolution observations and model results, by enabling fast network reconstruct from the calculation of statistical similarities between climate time series. It also enables network analysis at unprecedented scales on a variety of different sizes of input data sets.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis of convective quasi-equilibrium (CQE) has dominated thinking about the interaction between deep moist convection and the environment for at least two decades. In this view, deep convection develops or decays almost instantly to remove any changes of convective instability, making the tropospheric temperature always tied to the boundary layer moist static energy. The present study examines the validity of the CQE hypothesis at different vertical levels using long-term sounding data from tropical convection centers. The results show that the tropical atmosphere is far from the CQE with much weaker warming in the middle and upper troposphere associated with the increase of boundary layer moist static energy. This is true for all the time scales resolved by the observational data, ranging from hourly to interannual and decadal variability. It is possibly caused by the ubiquitous existence of shallow convection and stratiform precipitation, both leading to sign reversal of heating from lower to upper troposphere. The simulations by 42 global climate models from phases 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparsion Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5) are also analyzed and compared with the observations.},

This model, which contains terms representing both aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions, well represents the known time history of aerosol radiative forcing as well as the effect of the natural state on the strength of aerosol forcing. Model parameters, randomly drawn to represent uncertainty in understanding, demonstrate that a forcing more negative than −1.0 W m−2 is implausible, as it implies that none of the approximately 0.3-K temperature rise between 1850 and 1950 can be attributed to Northern Hemisphere forcing. The individual terms of the model are interpreted in light of comprehensive modeling, constraints from observations, and physical understanding to provide further support for the less negative (−1.0 W m−2) lower bound. These findings suggest that aerosol radiative forcing is less negative and more certain than is commonly believed.},

This analysis, however, did not reveal how these regimes evolve during the subsequent cloud development. To address this issue, we employed the Active Tracer High Resolution Atmospheric Model (ATHAM) with full microphysics and extended the model simulation from the cloud base to the entire column of a single pyro-convective mixed-phase cloud. A series of 2-D simulations (over 1000) were performed over a wide range of NCN and dynamic conditions. The integrated concentration of hydrometeors over the full spatial and temporal scales was used to evaluate the aerosol and dynamic effects. The results show the following. (1) The three regimes for cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation in the parcel model (namely aerosol-limited, updraft-limited, and transitional regimes) still exist within our simulations, but net production of raindrops and frozen particles occurs mostly within the updraft-limited regime. (2) Generally, elevated aerosols enhance the formation of cloud droplets and frozen particles. The response of raindrops and precipitation to aerosols is more complex and can be either positive or negative as a function of aerosol concentrations. The most negative effect was found for values of NCN of {\textasciitilde} 1000 to 3000 cm−3. (3) The nonlinear properties of aerosol–cloud interactions challenge the conclusions drawn from limited case studies in terms of their representativeness, and ensemble studies over a wide range of aerosol concentrations and other influencing factors are strongly recommended for a more robust assessment of the aerosol effects.},

	abstract = {Black carbon, brown carbon, and mineral dust are three of the most important light absorbing aerosols. Their optical properties differ greatly and are distinctive functions of the wavelength of light. Most optical instruments that quantify light absorption, however, are unable to distinguish one type of absorbing aerosol from another. It is thus instructive to separate total absorption from these different light absorbers to gain a better understanding of the optical characteristics of each aerosol type. During the EAST-AIRE (East Asian Study of Tropospheric Aerosols: an International Regional Experiment) campaign near Beijing, we measured light scattering using a nephelometer, and light absorption using an aethalometer and a particulate soot absorption photometer. We also measured the total mass concentrations of carbonaceous (elemental and organic carbon) and inorganic particulates, as well as aerosol number and mass distributions. We were able to identify periods during the campaign that were dominated by dust, biomass burning, fresh (industrial) chimney plumes, other coal burning pollution, and relatively clean (background) air for Northern China. Each of these air masses possessed distinct intensive optical properties, including the single scatter albedo and Ångstrom exponents. Based on the wavelength-dependence and particle size distribution, we apportioned total light absorption to black carbon, brown carbon, and dust; their mass absorption efficiencies at 550 nm were estimated to be 9.5, 0.5 (a lower limit value), and 0.03 m2/g, respectively. While agreeing with the common consensus that black carbon is the most important light absorber in the mid-visible, we demonstrated that brown carbon and dust could also cause significant absorption, especially at shorter wavelengths.},

	abstract = {We use the global circulation model ECHAM6 extended by the aerosol module HAM2 to simulate global patterns in wildfire emission heights. Prescribed plume heights in ECHAM6 are replaced by an implementation of a simple, semi-empirical plume height parametrization. In a first step, the global performance of the plume height parametrization is evaluated for plumes reported in the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) Plume Height Project (MPHP) data set. Our results show that the parametrization simulates a largely reasonable global distribution of plume heights. While the modeled global mean plume height (1411 ± 646 m) is in good agreement with the observed mean (1382 ± 702 m), the upper and lower tails of the plume height distribution tend to be slightly underrepresented. Furthermore, we compare plume heights simulated by the simple parametrization to a more complex, analytical plume model. Major differences in global plume height distributions are found for the lowest 1.5 km, but reasonable agreement is observed for higher plumes. In a second step, fire radiative power (FRP) as reported in the global fire assimilation system (GFAS) is used to simulate plume heights for observed fires globally for the period 2005–2011. The global fraction of simulated daytime plumes injecting emissions into the free troposphere (FT) ranges from 3.7 ± 0.7 to 5.2 ± 1.0 \%. This range is comparable to results from observational studies, but it is much lower than results for prescribed plume heights in the ECHAM6-HAM2 standard setup. Nevertheless, occasionally deep emission injections exceeding 5–7 km in height are simulated for intense fires and favorable meteorological conditions. The application of a prescribed diurnal cycle in FRP turns out to be of minor importance. For a hypothetical doubling in FRP, moderate changes in plume heights of 100–400 m are simulated. These small changes indicate that a potential future increase in fire intensity will only slightly impact the emission heights on a global scale.},

	abstract = {Aerosol–cloud interaction effects are a major source of uncertainty in climate models so it is important to quantify the sources of uncertainty and thereby direct research efforts. However, the computational expense of global aerosol models has prevented a full statistical analysis of their outputs. Here we perform a variance-based analysis of a global 3-D aerosol microphysics model to quantify the magnitude and leading causes of parametric uncertainty in model-estimated present-day concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Twenty-eight model parameters covering essentially all important aerosol processes, emissions and representation of aerosol size distributions were defined based on expert elicitation. An uncertainty analysis was then performed based on a Monte Carlo-type sampling of an emulator built for each model grid cell. The standard deviation around the mean CCN varies globally between about ±30\% over some marine regions to ±40–100\% over most land areas and high latitudes, implying that aerosol processes and emissions are likely to be a significant source of uncertainty in model simulations of aerosol–cloud effects on climate. Among the most important contributors to CCN uncertainty are the sizes of emitted primary particles, including carbonaceous combustion particles from wildfires, biomass burning and fossil fuel use, as well as sulfate particles formed on sub-grid scales. Emissions of carbonaceous combustion particles affect CCN uncertainty more than sulfur emissions. Aerosol emission-related parameters dominate the uncertainty close to sources, while uncertainty in aerosol microphysical processes becomes increasingly important in remote regions, being dominated by deposition and aerosol sulfate formation during cloud-processing. The results lead to several recommendations for research that would result in improved modelling of cloud–active aerosol on a global scale.},

The approach, however, is less straightforward for dynamic simulators, designed to represent time-evolving systems. Generalisations of the established methodology to allow for dynamic emulation are here proposed and contrasted.

	abstract = {We demonstrate a method for making probabilistic projections of climate change at global and regional scales, using examples consisting of the equilibrium response to doubled CO2 concentrations of global annual mean temperature and regional climate changes in summer and winter temperature and precipitation over Northern Europe and England-Wales. This method combines information from a perturbed physics ensemble, a set of international climate models, and observations. Our approach is based on a multivariate Bayesian framework which enables the prediction of a joint probability distribution for several variables constrained by more than one observational metric. This is important if different sets of impacts scientists are to use these probabilistic projections to make coherent forecasts for the impacts of climate change, by inputting several uncertain climate variables into their impacts models. Unlike a single metric, multiple metrics reduce the risk of rewarding a model variant which scores well due to a fortuitous compensation of errors rather than because it is providing a realistic simulation of the observed quantity. We provide some physical interpretation of how the key metrics constrain our probabilistic projections. The method also has a quantity, called discrepancy, which represents the degree of imperfection in the climate model i.e. it measures the extent to which missing processes, choices of parameterisation schemes and approximations in the climate model affect our ability to use outputs from climate models to make inferences about the real system. Other studies have, sometimes without realising it, treated the climate model as if it had no model error. We show that omission of discrepancy increases the risk of making over-confident predictions. Discrepancy also provides a transparent way of incorporating improvements in subsequent generations of climate models into probabilistic assessments. The set of international climate models is used to derive some numbers for the discrepancy term for the perturbed physics ensemble, and associated caveats with doing this are discussed.},

The ensemble allows realistic, spatially and temporally variable model covariances (unlike other assimilation schemes). As the analyzed variables are mixing ratios (prognostic variables of the aerosol transport model), there is no need for the extra assumptions required by previous assimilation schemes analyzing aerosol optical thickness (AOT).
 We describe the implementation of this assimilation system and in particular the construction of the ensemble. This ensemble should represent our estimate of current model uncertainties. Consequently, we construct the ensemble around randomly modified emission scenarios.
 The system is tested with AERONET observations of AOT and Angström exponent (AE). Particular care is taken in prescribing the observational errors. The assimilated fields (AOT and AE) are validated through independent AERONET, SKYNET and MODIS Aqua observations. We show that, in general, assimilation of AOT observations leads to improved modelling of global AOT, while assimilation of AE only improves modelling when the AOT is high.},

This technique takes advantage of the fact that most of the information about the spatial distribution of sources and sinks is observable within a few months to half of a year of emission. After this period, the spatial structure of sources is diluted by transport and cannot significantly constrain flux estimates. We therefore describe an estimation technique that steps through the observations sequentially, using only the subset of observations and modeled transport fields that most strongly constrain the fluxes at a particular time step. Estimates of each set of fluxes are sequentially updated multiple times, using measurements taken at different times, and the estimates and their uncertainties are shown to quickly converge. Final flux estimates are incorporated into the background state of CO2 and transported forward in time, and the final flux uncertainties and covariances are taken into account when estimating the covariances of the fluxes still being estimated. The computational demands of this technique are greatly reduced in comparison to the standard Bayesian synthesis technique where all observations are used at once with transport fields spanning the entire period of the observations. It therefore becomes possible to solve larger inverse problems with more observations and for fluxes discretized at finer spatial scales. We also discuss the differences between running the inversion simultaneously with the transport model and running it entirely off-line with pre-calculated transport fields. We find that the latter can be done with minimal error if time series of transport fields of adequate length are pre-calculated.},

A brief description of recent model improvements is made. A combined balance and dynamics initialization procedure designed to introduce variable magnitudes and distributions of low-level wind convergence to the initial fields is described. Using radiosonde and PIBAL data collected by the NOAA/ERL Florida Area Cumulus Experiment (FACE) and the National Weather Service at Miami on 17 July 1973, composite wind, temperature, pressure and moisture profiles were constructed to depict the state of the atmosphere at the time of deep convection. Mesoscale convergence was estimated from results of a mesoscale model simulation of low-level sea breeze convergence made by Pielke (personal communication) for the same case study day. Several numerical simulations were performed using the sounding data as a basic state. The initial magnitude and distribution of low-level convergence was varied and the sensitivity of the model to some micro-physical parameters was examined. The results of the numerical experiments show that (i) the magnitude of surface convergence over a finite area has a pronounced influence on the simulated storm circulation, the eddy kinetic energy of the storm and the total rainfall of the storm system; (ii) the horizontal distribution of convergence has a relatively large effect on the rates of entrainment into the updraft below 5 km MSL resulting in significant modulations in predicted precipitation, but only moderate changes in storm kinetic energy; (iii) variations in terminal velocity of precipitation associated with the introduction of the ice phase has only a minor effect on precipitation and total kinetic energy of the storm; and (iv) increased rain evaporation rates result in a moderate increase in the kinetic energy of the simulated storm, but at the expense of surface precipitation. Pressure forces are also shown to play an important role in initiating downdrafts and in biasing the direction of downdraft-associated outflow. Implications of these results to the modification of convective clouds are discussed.},

Nonabsorbing, hydrophilic aerosols, such as sulfate, potentially affect atmospheric absorption in opposing ways: first, decreasing absorption through aging initially hydrophobic black carbon (BC) to a hydrophilic state, enhancing its removal by wet scavenging, and consequently decreasing BC lifetime and abundance, and second, increasing absorption through enhancement of the BC absorption efficiency by internal mixing as well as through increasing the amount of diffuse solar radiation in the atmosphere. On the basis of General Circulation Model studies with an embedded microphysical aerosol module we systematically demonstrate the significance of these mechanisms both on the global and regional scales. In remote transport regions, the first mechanism prevails, reducing atmospheric absorption, whereas in the vicinity of source regions, despite enhanced wet scavenging, absorption is enhanced owing to the prevalence of the second mechanisms. Our findings imply that the sulfur to BC emission ratio plays a key role in aerosol absorption.},

	abstract = {Many theories have been proposed detailing how aerosols might impact precipitation, predicting both increases and decreases depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions and aerosol type.  In convective clouds, increased aerosol concentrations have been speculated to invigorate convective activity.  Previous studies have shown large increases in precipitation with increasing aerosol optical depth, concluding an aerosol effect on precipitation.  Our analysis reveals that these studies may have been influenced by cloud effects on the retrieved aerosol, as well as by meteorological covariations.
 We use a regime-based approach to separate out different cloud regimes, allowing for the study of aerosol–cloud interactions in individual cloud regimes. We account for the influence of cloud properties on the aerosol retrieval and make use of the diurnal sampling of the TRMM satellite and the TRMM merged precipitation product to investigate the precipitation development.
 We find that whilst there is little effect on precipitation at the time of the aerosol retrieval, in the 6 h after the aerosol retrieval, there is an increase in precipitation from cloud in high-aerosol environments, consistent with the invigoration hypothesis.  Increases in lightning flash count with increased aerosol are also observed in this period.  The invigoration effect appears to be dependent on the cloud-top temperature, with clouds with tops colder than 0 °C showing increases in precipitation at times after the retrieval, as well as increases in wet scavenging.  Warm clouds show little change in precipitation development with increasing aerosol, suggesting ice processes are important for the invigoration of precipitation.},

These studies generally find a positive Nd sensitivity to AOD changes over ocean, but some find a negative sensitivity over land, in contrast to that predicted by models and theory. Here we investigate the Ndsensitivity to AOD in different cloud regimes, determined using a k-means clustering process on retrieved cloud properties. We find the strongest positive Nd sensitivity in the stratiform regimes over both land and ocean, providing the majority of the total sensitivity. The negative sensitivity previously observed over land is generated by the low cloud fraction regimes, suggesting that it is due to the difficulty of retrieving Nd at low cloud fractions. When considering a mean sensitivity, weighted by liquid cloud fraction to account for sampling biases, we find an increased sensitivity over land, in some regions becoming positive. This highlights the importance of regime based analysis when studying aerosol indirect effects.},

	abstract = {A new version of the Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) is described, which uses a two-moment pseudo-modal aerosol dynamics approach rather than the original two-moment bin scheme. GLOMAP-mode simulates the multi-component global aerosol, resolving sulfate, sea-salt, dust, black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM), the latter including primary and biogenic secondary POM. Aerosol processes are simulated in a size-resolved manner including primary emissions, secondary particle formation by binary homogeneous nucleation of sulfuric acid and water, particle growth by coagulation, condensation and cloud-processing and removal by dry deposition, in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging. A series of benchmark observational datasets are assembled against which the skill of the model is assessed in terms of normalised mean bias (b) and correlation coefficient (R). Overall, the model performs well against the datasets in simulating concentrations of aerosol precursor gases, chemically speciated particle mass, condensation nuclei (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Surface sulfate, sea-salt and dust mass concentrations are all captured well, while BC and POM are biased low (but correlate well). Surface CN concentrations compare reasonably well in free troposphere and marine sites, but are underestimated at continental and coastal sites related to underestimation of either primary particle emissions or new particle formation. The model compares well against a compilation of CCN observations covering a range of environments and against vertical profiles of size-resolved particle concentrations over Europe. The simulated global burden, lifetime and wet removal of each of the simulated aerosol components is also examined and each lies close to multi-model medians from the AEROCOM model intercomparison exercise.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the aerosol schemes in current climate models is dependent upon the available observational data. In-situ observations from flight campaigns can provide valuable data about the vertical distribution of aerosol that is difficult to obtain from satellite or ground-based platforms, although they are localised in space and time. Using single-particle soot-photometer (SP2) measurements from the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) campaign, which consists of many vertical profiles over a large region of the Pacific, we evaluate the meridional and vertical distribution of black carbon (BC) aerosol simulated by the HadGEM3–UKCA and ECHAM5–HAM2 models. Both models show a similar pattern of overestimating the BC column burden compared to that derived from the observations, in many areas by an order of magnitude. However, by sampling the simulated BC mass mixing ratio along the flight track and comparing to the observations, we show that this discrepancy has a rather different vertical structure in the two models: in HadGEM3–UKCA the discrepancy is dominated by excess aerosol in the tropical upper troposphere, while in ECHAM5–HAM2 areas of discrepancy are spread across many different latitudes and altitudes. Using this methodology, we conduct sensitivity tests on two specific elements of the models: biomass-burning emissions and scavenging by convective precipitation. We show that, by coupling the convective scavenging more tightly with convective transport, both the column burden and vertical distribution of BC in HadGEM3–UKCA are much improved with respect to the observations, with a substantial and statistically significant increase in correlation – this demonstrates the importance of a realistic representation of this process. In contrast, updating from GFED2 to GFED3.1 biomass-burning emissions makes a more modest improvement in both models, which is not statistically significant. By comparing our results with a more traditional approach using regional- and monthly-mean vertical profile curves, we show that the point-by-point analysis allows the model improvements to be demonstrated more clearly. We also demonstrate the important role that nudged simulations (where the large-scale model dynamics are continuously relaxed towards a reanalysis) can play in this type of evaluation, allowing statistically significant differences between configurations of the aerosol scheme to be seen where the differences between the corresponding free-running simulations would not be significant.},

	abstract = {Simulated multi-model "diversity" in aerosol direct radiative forcing estimates is often perceived as a measure of aerosol uncertainty. However, current models used for aerosol radiative forcing calculations vary considerably in model components relevant for forcing calculations and the associated "host-model uncertainties" are generally convoluted with the actual aerosol uncertainty. In this AeroCom Prescribed intercomparison study we systematically isolate and quantify host model uncertainties on aerosol forcing experiments through prescription of identical aerosol radiative properties in twelve participating models. Even with prescribed aerosol radiative properties, simulated clear-sky and all-sky aerosol radiative forcings show significant diversity. For a purely scattering case with globally constant optical depth of 0.2, the global-mean all-sky top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing is −4.47 Wm−2 and the inter-model standard deviation is 0.55 Wm−2, corresponding to a relative standard deviation of 12\%. For a case with partially absorbing aerosol with an aerosol optical depth of 0.2 and single scattering albedo of 0.8, the forcing changes to 1.04 Wm−2, and the standard deviation increases to 1.01 W−2, corresponding to a significant relative standard deviation of 97\%. However, the top-of-atmosphere forcing variability owing to absorption (subtracting the scattering case from the case with scattering and absorption) is low, with absolute (relative) standard deviations of 0.45 Wm−2 (8\%) clear-sky and 0.62 Wm−2 (11\%) all-sky. Scaling the forcing standard deviation for a purely scattering case to match the sulfate radiative forcing in the AeroCom Direct Effect experiment demonstrates that host model uncertainties could explain about 36\% of the overall sulfate forcing diversity of 0.11 Wm−2 in the AeroCom Direct Radiative Effect experiment. Host model errors in aerosol radiative forcing are largest in regions of uncertain host model components, such as stratocumulus cloud decks or areas with poorly constrained surface albedos, such as sea ice. Our results demonstrate that host model uncertainties are an important component of aerosol forcing uncertainty that require further attention.},

	abstract = {We report on the AeroCom Phase II direct aerosol effect (DAE) experiment where 16 detailed global aerosol models have been used to simulate the changes in the aerosol distribution over the industrial era. All 16 models have estimated the radiative forcing (RF) of the anthropogenic DAE, and have taken into account anthropogenic sulphate, black carbon (BC) and organic aerosols (OA) from fossil fuel, biofuel, and biomass burning emissions. In addition several models have simulated the DAE of anthropogenic nitrate and anthropogenic influenced secondary organic aerosols (SOA). The model simulated all-sky RF of the DAE from total anthropogenic aerosols has a range from −0.58 to −0.02 Wm−2, with a mean of −0.27 Wm−2 for the 16 models. Several models did not include nitrate or SOA and modifying the estimate by accounting for this with information from the other AeroCom models reduces the range and slightly strengthens the mean. Modifying the model estimates for missing aerosol components and for the time period 1750 to 2010 results in a mean RF for the DAE of −0.35 Wm−2. Compared to AeroCom Phase I (Schulz et al., 2006) we find very similar spreads in both total DAE and aerosol component RF. However, the RF of the total DAE is stronger negative and RF from BC from fossil fuel and biofuel emissions are stronger positive in the present study than in the previous AeroCom study. We find a tendency for models having a strong (positive) BC RF to also have strong (negative) sulphate or OA RF. This relationship leads to smaller uncertainty in the total RF of the DAE compared to the RF of the sum of the individual aerosol components. The spread in results for the individual aerosol components is substantial, and can be divided into diversities in burden, mass extinction coefficient (MEC), and normalized RF with respect to AOD. We find that these three factors give similar contributions to the spread in results.},

Over the range of excitation power density where the depth of the S-shape is reduced, we also observe a reduction in the integrated photoluminescence intensity per unit excitation power, i.e., efficiency droop. Hence, the onset of efficiency droop occurs at the same carrier density as the onset of carrier delocalization. We correlate these experimental results with the predictions of a theoretical model of the effects of carrier localization due to local variations in the concentration of the randomly distributed In atoms on the optical properties of InGaN/GaN quantum wells. On the basis of this comparison of theory with experiment we attribute the reduction in the S-shape temperature dependence to the saturation of the available localized states. We propose that this saturation of the localized states is a contributory factor to efficiency droop whereby nonlocalized carriers recombine non-radiatively.},

It is found that retrieved aerosol optical depth and aerosol size both increase near the center of the composite extratropical cyclones. Using composites of ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data, it is demonstrated that wind speed is a considerably more likely explanatory variable than relative humidity for the aerosol observations. A comparison of composites for both MODIS and AATSR, which uses a wind speed dependent sea-surface brightness model in the aerosol retrieval, suggests that although surface brightness eects may contribute towards some of the observations, wind speed dependent emission of sea salt also appears to make a signicant contribution to the observed aerosol properties.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive examination of aerosol absorption with a focus on evaluating the sensitivity of the global distribution of aerosol absorption to key uncertainties in the process representation. For this purpose we extended the comprehensive aerosol-climate model ECHAM5-HAM by effective medium approximations for the calculation of aerosol effective refractive indices, updated black carbon refractive indices, new cloud radiative properties considering the effect of aerosol inclusions, as well as by modules for the calculation of long-wave aerosol radiative properties and instantaneous aerosol forcing. The evaluation of the simulated aerosol absorption optical depth with the AERONET sun-photometer network shows a good agreement in the large scale global patterns. On a regional basis it becomes evident that the update of the BC refractive indices to Bond and Bergstrom (2006) significantly improves the previous underestimation of the aerosol absorption optical depth. In the global annual-mean, absorption acts to reduce the short-wave anthropogenic aerosol top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative forcing clear-sky from −0.79 to −0.53 W m−2 (33\%) and all-sky from −0.47 to −0.13 W m−2 (72\%). Our results confirm that basic assumptions about the BC refractive index play a key role for aerosol absorption and radiative forcing. The effect of the usage of more accurate effective medium approximations is comparably small. We demonstrate that the diversity in the AeroCom land-surface albedo fields contributes to the uncertainty in the simulated anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcings: the usage of an upper versus lower bound of the AeroCom land albedos introduces a global annual-mean TOA forcing range of 0.19 W m−2 (36\%) clear-sky and of 0.12 W m−2 (92\%) all-sky. The consideration of black carbon inclusions on cloud radiative properties results in a small global annual-mean all-sky absorption of 0.05 W m−2 and a positive TOA forcing perturbation of 0.02 W m−2. The long-wave aerosol radiative effects are small for anthropogenic aerosols but become of relevance for the larger natural dust and sea-salt aerosols.},

To date there have been several explanations for this phenomena, although no consensus has emerged as to the controlling mechanism(s). In this paper we report on the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence emission from an InGaN/GaN quantum well structure as a function of excitation level. We have observed a reduction in the S-shape temperature dependence of the peak of the emission spectrum at an excitation level that coincides with the onset of the efficiency droop. We suggest that both the efficiency droop and the reduction in the observed S-shape temperature dependence are caused by saturation of the available localised states within the quantum well.

However, these studies ignored the impacts of forests on atmospheric aerosol. We use a global atmospheric model to show that, through emission of organic vapours and the resulting condensational growth of newly formed particles, boreal forests double regional cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (from approx. 100 to approx. 200 cm−3). Using a simple radiative model, we estimate that the resulting change in cloud albedo causes a radiative forcing of between −1.8 and −6.7 W m−2 of forest. This forcing may be sufficiently large to result in boreal forests having an overall cooling impact on climate. We propose that the combination of climate forcings related to boreal forests may result in an important global homeostasis. In cold climatic conditions, the snow–vegetation albedo effect dominates and boreal forests warm the climate, whereas in warmer climates they may emit sufficiently large amounts of organic vapour modifying cloud albedo and acting to cool climate.},

Both a detailed large eddy simulation of the dynamics and microphysics of a precipitating shallow boundary layer cloud system and a simpler model built upon basic physical principles, reproduce predator-prey behavior with rain acting as the predator and cloud as the prey. The aerosol is shown to modulate the predator-prey response. Steady-state solution to the proposed model shows the known existence of bistability in cloudiness. Three regimes are identified in the time-dependent solutions: (i) the weakly precipitating regime where cloud and rain coexist in a quasi steady state; (ii) the moderately drizzling regime where limit-cycle behavior in the cloud and rain fields is produced; and (iii) the heavily precipitating clouds where collapse of the boundary layer is predicted. The manifestation of predator-prey behavior in the aerosol–cloud–precipitation system is a further example of the self-organizing properties of the system and suggests that exploiting principles of population dynamics may help reduce complex aerosol–cloud–rain interactions to a more tractable problem.},

	abstract = {Marine stratocumulus clouds cover nearly one-quarter of the ocean surface and thus play an extremely important role in determining the global radiative balance. The semipermanent marine stratocumulus deck over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean is of particular interest, because of its interactions with seasonal biomass burning aerosols that are emitted in southern Africa. Understanding the impacts of biomass burning aerosols on stratocumulus clouds and the implications for regional and global radiative balance is still very limited. Previous studies have focused on assessing the magnitude of the warming caused by solar scattering and absorption by biomass burning aerosols over stratocumulus (the direct radiative effect) or cloud adjustments to the direct radiative effect (the semidirect effect). Here, using a nested modeling approach in conjunction with observations from multiple satellites, we demonstrate that cloud condensation nuclei activated from biomass burning aerosols entrained into the stratocumulus (the microphysical effect) can play a dominant role in determining the total radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere, compared with their direct and semidirect radiative effects. Biomass burning aerosols over the region and period with heavy loadings can cause a substantial cooling (daily mean −8.05 W m−2), primarily as a result of clouds brightening by reducing the cloud droplet size (the Twomey effect) and secondarily through modulating the diurnal cycle of cloud liquid water path and coverage (the cloud lifetime effect). Our results highlight the importance of realistically representing the interactions of stratocumulus with biomass burning aerosols in global climate models in this region.},

	abstract = {Black carbon (BC) exerts profound impacts on air quality and climate because of its high absorption cross-section over a broad range of electromagnetic spectra, but the current results on absorption enhancement of BC particles during atmospheric aging remain conflicting. Here, we quantified the aging and variation in the optical properties of BC particles under ambient conditions in Beijing, China, and Houston, United States, using a novel environmental chamber approach. BC aging exhibits two distinct stages, i.e., initial transformation from a fractal to spherical morphology with little absorption variation and subsequent growth of fully compact particles with a large absorption enhancement. The timescales to achieve complete morphology modification and an absorption amplification factor of 2.4 for BC particles are estimated to be 2.3 h and 4.6 h, respectively, in Beijing, compared with 9 h and 18 h, respectively, in Houston. Our findings indicate that BC under polluted urban environments could play an essential role in pollution development and contribute importantly to large positive radiative forcing. The variation in direct radiative forcing is dependent on the rate and timescale of BC aging, with a clear distinction between urban cities in developed and developing countries, i.e., a higher climatic impact in more polluted environments. We suggest that mediation in BC emissions achieves a cobenefit in simultaneously controlling air pollution and protecting climate, especially for developing countries.},

The enormity of the problem is reflected in the need to understand aspects such as aerosol composition, optical properties, cloud condensation, and ice nucleation potential, along with the global distribution of these properties, controlled by emissions, transport, transformation, and sinks. Equally daunting is that clouds themselves are complex, turbulent, microphysical entities and, by their very nature, ephemeral and hard to predict. Atmospheric general circulation models represent aerosol−cloud interactions at ever-increasing levels of detail, but these models lack the resolution to represent clouds and aerosol−cloud interactions adequately. There is a dearth of observational constraints on aerosol−cloud interactions. We develop a conceptual approach to systematically constrain the aerosol−cloud radiative effect in shallow clouds through a combination of routine process modeling and satellite and surface-based shortwave radiation measurements. We heed the call to merge Darwinian and Newtonian strategies by balancing microphysical detail with scaling and emergent properties of the aerosol−cloud radiation system.},

Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS’ Data Collection Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75\% of the Earth’s surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90\% in 1998.

	abstract = {This paper reviews the many developments in estimates of the direct and indirect global annual mean radiative forcing due to present‐day concentrations of anthropogenic tropospheric aerosols since Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [1996]. The range of estimates of the global mean direct radiative forcing due to six distinct aerosol types is presented. Additionally, the indirect effect is split into two components corresponding to the radiative forcing due to modification of the radiative properties of clouds (cloud albedo effect) and the effects of anthropogenic aerosols upon the lifetime of clouds (cloud lifetime effect). The radiative forcing for anthropogenic sulphate aerosol ranges from −0.26 to −0.82 W m−2. For fossil fuel black carbon the radiative forcing ranges from +0.16 W m−2 for an external mixture to +0.42 W m−2 for where the black carbon is modeled as internally mixed with sulphate aerosol. For fossil fuel organic carbon the two estimates of the likely weakest limit of the direct radiative forcing are −0.02 and −0.04 W m−2. For biomass‐burning sources of black carbon and organic carbon the combined radiative forcing ranges from −0.14 to −0.74 W m−2. Estimates of the radiative forcing due to mineral dust vary widely from +0.09 to −0.46 W m−2; even the sign of the radiative forcing is not well established due to the competing effects of solar and terrestrial radiative forcings. A single study provides a very tentative estimate of the radiative forcing of nitrates to be −0.03 W m−2. Estimates of the cloud albedo indirect radiative forcing range from −0.3 to approximately −1.8 W m−2. Although the cloud lifetime effect is identified as a potentially important climate forcing mechanism, it is difficult to quantify in the context of the present definition of radiative forcing of climate change and current model simulations. This is because its estimation by general circulation models necessarily includes some level of cloud and water vapor feedbacks, which affect the hydrological cycle and the dynamics of the atmosphere. Available models predict that the radiative flux perturbation associated with the cloud lifetime effect is of a magnitude similar to that of the cloud albedo effect.},

Over the southeast Atlantic, large areas of stratocumulus are rapidly eroded, yielding partial or complete clearing along sharp transitions hundreds to thousands of kilometers in length that move westward at 8 to 12 meters per second and travel as far as 1000+ kilometers from the African coast. The westward-moving cloudiness reductions have an annual peak in occurrence in April-May-June. The cloud erosion boundaries reduce cloud at ≈10-kilometer scale in less than 15 minutes, move approximately perpendicular to the mean flow, and are often accompanied by small-scale wave features. Observations suggest that the cloud erosion is caused by atmospheric gravity waves.},

At the same time, it is still considerably lower than the 6.5 to 7\% K−1 decrease of the water vapor concentration with cooling from anthropogenic aerosol because the water vapor radiative feedback lowers the hydrological sensitivity to anthropogenic forcings. When GHG and aerosol forcings are combined, the climate models with a realistic 20th century warming indicate that the global mean precipitation increase due to GHG warming has, until recently, been completely masked by aerosol drying. This explains the apparent lack of sensitivity of the global mean precipitation to the net global warming recently found in observations. As the importance of GHG warming increases in the future, a clear signal will emerge.},

	abstract = {This paper is due to appear as a chapter of the forthcoming Handbook of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) by S. Sisson, L. Fan, and M. Beaumont. We describe the challenge of calibrating climate simulators, and discuss the differences in emphasis in climate science compared to many of the more traditional ABC application areas. The primary difficulty is how to do inference with a computationally expensive simulator which we can only afford to run a small number of times, and we describe how Gaussian process emulators are used as surrogate models in this case. We introduce the idea of history matching, which is a non-probabilistic calibration method, which divides the parameter space into (not im)plausible and implausible regions. History matching can be shown to be a special case of ABC, but with a greater emphasis on defining realistic simulator discrepancy bounds, and using these to define tolerances and metrics. We describe a design approach for choosing parameter values at which to run the simulator, and illustrate the approach on a toy climate model, showing that with careful design we can find the plausible region with a very small number of model evaluations. Finally, we describe how calibrated GENIE-1 (an earth system model of intermediate complexity) predictions have been used, and why it is important to accurately characterise parametric uncertainty.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed budget of the changes in atmospheric aerosol mass and numbers due to various processes: emission (including instant condensation of soluble biogenic emissions), nucleation, coagulation, H2SO4 condensation and in-cloud production, aging and deposition. The budget is created from monthly averaged tracer tendencies calculated by the global aerosol model ECHAM5.5-HAM2 and allows us to investigate process contributions at various length-scales and timescales. As a result, we show in unprecedented detail what processes drive the evolution of aerosol. In particular, we show that the processes that affect aerosol masses are quite different from those that affect aerosol numbers. Condensation of H2SO4 gas onto pre-existing particles is an important process, dominating the growth of small particles in the nucleation mode to the Aitken mode and the aging of hydrophobic matter. Together with in-cloud production of H2SO4, it significantly contributes to (and often dominates) the mass burden (and hence composition) of the hydrophilic Aitken and accumulation mode particles. Particle growth itself is the leading source of number densities in the hydrophilic Aitken and accumulation modes, with their hydrophobic counterparts contributing (even locally) relatively little. As expected, the coarse mode is dominated by primary emissions and mostly decoupled from the smaller modes. Our analysis also suggests that coagulation serves mainly as a loss process for number densities and that, relative to other processes, it is a rather unimportant contributor to composition changes of aerosol. The analysis is extended with sensitivity studies where the impact of a lower model resolution or pre-industrial emissions is shown to be small. We discuss the use of the current budget for model simplification, prioritization of model improvements, identification of potential structural model errors and model evaluation against observations.},

	abstract = {Aerosol–cloud interactions are considered a key uncertainty in our understanding of climate change (Boucher et al., 2013). Knowledge of the global abundance of aerosols suitable to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is fundamental to determine the strength of the anthropogenic climate perturbation. Direct measurements are limited and sample only a very small fraction of the globe so that remote sensing from satellites and ground based instruments is widely used as a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (Nakajima et al., 2001; Andreae, 2009; Clarke and Kapustin, 2010; Boucher et al., 2013). However, the underlying assumptions cannot be robustly tested with the small number of measurements available so that no reliable global estimate of cloud condensation nuclei exists. This study overcomes this limitation using a fully self-consistent global model (ECHAM-HAM) of aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei. An analysis of the correlation of simulated aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei reveals that common assumptions about their relationships are violated for a significant fraction of the globe: 71 \% of the area of the globe shows correlation coefficients between CCN0.2\% at cloud base and aerosol optical depth (AOD) below 0.5, i.e. AOD variability explains only 25 \% of the CCN variance. This has significant implications for satellite based studies of aerosol–cloud interactions. The findings also suggest that vertically resolved remote sensing techniques, such as satellite-based high spectral resolution lidars, have a large potential for global monitoring of cloud condensation nuclei.},

The response of atmospheric aerosols to these changes and the impact on climate are poorly constrained, particularly in studies using detailed aerosol chemistry–climate models. Here we compare the HadGEM3-UKCA (Hadley Centre Global Environment Model-United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols) coupled chemistry–climate model for the period 1960–2009 against extensive ground-based observations of sulfate aerosol mass (1978–2009), total suspended particle matter (SPM, 1978–1998), PM10 (1997–2009), aerosol optical depth (AOD, 2000–2009), aerosol size distributions (2008–2009) and surface solar radiation (SSR, 1960–2009) over Europe. The model underestimates observed sulfate aerosol mass (normalised mean bias factor (NMBF) = −0.4), SPM (NMBF = −0.9), PM10 (NMBF = −0.2), aerosol number concentrations (N30 NMBF = −0.85; N50 NMBF = −0.65; and N100 NMBF = −0.96) and  AOD (NMBF = −0.01) but slightly overpredicts SSR (NMBF = 0.02). Trends in aerosol over the observational period are well simulated by the model, with observed (simulated) changes in sulfate of −68 \% (−78 \%), SPM of −42 \% (−20 \%), PM10 of −9 \% (−8 \%) and AOD of −11 \% (−14 \%). Discrepancies in the magnitude of simulated aerosol mass do not affect the ability of the model to reproduce the observed SSR trends. The positive change in observed European SSR (5 \%) during 1990–2009 ("brightening") is better reproduced by the model when aerosol radiative effects (ARE) are included (3 \%), compared to simulations where ARE are excluded (0.2 \%). The simulated top-of-the-atmosphere aerosol radiative forcing over Europe under all-sky conditions increased by {\textgreater} 3.0 W m−2 during the period 1970–2009 in response to changes in anthropogenic emissions and aerosol concentrations.},

	abstract = {The effect of ocean acidification and changing water conditions on primary (and secondary) marine aerosol emissions is not well understood on a regional or a global scale. To investigate this effect as well as the indirect effect on aerosol that changing biogeochemical parameters can have, {\textasciitilde} 52 m3 pelagic mesocosms were deployed for several weeks in the Mediterranean Sea during both winter pre-bloom and summer oligotrophic conditions and were subjected to various levels of CO2 to simulate the conditions foreseen in this region for the coming decades. After seawater sampling, primary bubble-bursting aerosol experiments were performed using a plunging water jet system to test both chemical and physical aerosol parameters (10–400 nm). Comparing results obtained during pre-bloom and oligotrophic conditions, we find the same four log-normal modal diameters (18.5 ± 0.6, 37.5 ± 1.4, 91.5 ± 2.0, 260 ± 3.2 nm) describing the aerosol size distribution during both campaigns, yet pre-bloom conditions significantly increased the number fraction of the second (Aitken) mode, with an amplitude correlated to virus-like particles, heterotrophic prokaryotes, TEPs (transparent exopolymeric particles), chlorophyll a and other pigments. Organic fractions determined from kappa closure calculations for the diameter, Dp {\textasciitilde} 50 nm, were much larger during the pre-bloom period (64 \%) than during the oligotrophic period (38 \%), and the organic fraction decreased as the particle size increased. Combining data from both campaigns together, strong positive correlations were found between the organic fraction of the aerosol and chlorophyll a concentrations, heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria abundance, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. As a consequence of the changes in the organic fraction and the size distributions between pre-bloom and oligotrophic periods, we find that the ratio of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to condensation nuclei (CN) slightly decreased during the pre-bloom period. The enrichment of the seawater samples with microlayer samples did not have any effect on the size distribution, organic content or the CCN activity of the generated primary aerosol. Partial pressure of CO2, pCO2, perturbations had little effect on the physical or chemical parameters of the aerosol emissions, with larger effects observed due to the differences between a pre-bloom and oligotrophic environment.},

In this study, the prevalence, sources, and optical importance of this so-called brown carbon (BrC) aerosol component are investigated throughout the North American continental tropospheric column during a summer of extensive biomass burning. Spectrophotometric absorption measurements on extracts of bulk aerosol samples collected from an aircraft over the central USA were analyzed to directly quantify BrC abundance. BrC was found to be prevalent throughout the 1 to 12 km altitude measurement range, with dramatic enhancements in biomass-burning plumes. BrC to black carbon (BC) ratios, under background tropospheric conditions, increased with altitude, consistent with a corresponding increase in the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) determined from a three-wavelength particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP). The sum of inferred BC absorption and measured BrC absorption at 365 nm was within 3 \% of the measured PSAP absorption for background conditions and 22 \% for biomass burning. A radiative transfer model showed that BrC absorption reduced top-of-atmosphere (TOA) aerosol forcing by {\textasciitilde} 20 \% in the background troposphere. Extensive radiative model simulations applying this study background tropospheric conditions provided a look-up chart for determining radiative forcing efficiencies of BrC as a function of a surface-measured BrC : BC ratio and single scattering albedo (SSA). The chart is a first attempt to provide a tool for better assessment of brown carbon's forcing effect when one is limited to only surface data. These results indicate that BrC is an important contributor to direct aerosol radiative forcing.},

Our best estimate of the BC emissions is 49.9 Gg at 2° × 2.5° (a factor of 2.1 increase) and 47.3 Gg at 0.5° × 0.667° (1.9 times increase). Model results now capture the observed major fire episodes with substantial bias reductions ({\textasciitilde} 35 \% at 2° × 2.5° and {\textasciitilde} 15 \% at 0.5° × 0.667°). The emissions are {\textasciitilde} 20–50 \% larger than those from our earlier analytical inversions (Mao et al., 2014). The discrepancy is especially drastic in the partitioning of anthropogenic versus biomass burning emissions. The August biomass burning BC emissions are 4.6–6.5 Gg and anthropogenic BC emissions 8.6–12.8 Gg, varying with the model resolution, error specifications, and subsets of observations used. On average both anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions in the adjoint inversions increase 2-fold relative to the respective \{a priori\} emissions, in distinct contrast to the halving of the anthropogenic and tripling of the biomass burning emissions in the analytical inversions. We attribute these discrepancies to the inability of the adjoint inversion system, with limited spatiotemporal coverage of the IMPROVE observations, to effectively distinguish collocated anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions on model grid scales. This calls for concurrent measurements of other tracers of biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion (e.g., carbon monoxide and carbon isotopes). We find that the adjoint inversion system as is has sufficient information content to constrain the total emissions of BC on the model grid scales.},

	abstract = {Marine stratocumulus clouds (MSC) cover large areas over the oceans and possess super sensitivity of their cloud radiative effect to changes in aerosol concentrations. Aerosols can cause transitions between regimes of fully cloudy closed cells and open cells. The possible role of aerosols in cloud cover has a big impact on the amount of reflected solar radiation from the clouds, thus potentially constitutes very large aerosol indirect radiative effect, which can exceed 100 Wm−2. It is hypothesized that continentally polluted clouds remain in closed cells regime for longer time from leaving continent and hence for longer distance away from land, thus occupying larger ocean areas with full cloud cover. Attributing this to anthropogenic aerosols would imply a very large negative radiative forcing with a significant climate impact. This possibility is confirmed by analyzing a detailed case study based on geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite observations of the microphysical and dynamical evolution of MSC. We show that large area of closed cells was formed over the northeast Atlantic Ocean downwind of Europe in a continentally polluted air mass. The closed cells undergo cleansing process that was tracked for 3.5 days that resulted with a rapid transition from closed to open cells once the clouds started drizzling heavily. The mechanism leading to the eventual breakup of the clouds due to both meteorological and aerosol considerations is elucidated. We termed this cleansing and cloud breakup process maritimization.

Although the form of this diagram is general, it is especially useful in evaluating complex models, such as those used to study geophysical phenomena. Examples are given showing that the diagram can be used to summarize the relative merits of a collection of different models or to track changes in performance of a model as it is modified. Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors. The geometric relationship between the statistics plotted on the diagram also provides some guidance for devising skill scores that appropriately weight among the various measures of pattern correspondence.},

The deviation of 1 km horizontal average data from this approximation is typically within a factor of 2.0. ∂logCCN / ∂logσ is less than unity because, among other explanations, growth processes generally make aerosols scatter more light without increasing their number. This, barring special meteorology–aerosol connections, associates a doubling of aerosol optical depth with less than a doubling of CCN, contrary to previous studies based on heavily averaged measurements or a satellite algorithm.},

	abstract = {Satellite studies of aerosol–cloud interactions usually make use of retrievals of both aerosol and cloud properties, but these retrievals are rarely spatially co-located. While it is possible to retrieve aerosol properties above clouds under certain circumstances, aerosol properties are usually only retrieved in cloud-free scenes. Generally, the smaller spatial variability of aerosols compared to clouds reduces the importance of this sampling difference. However, as precipitation generates an increase in spatial variability of aerosols, the imperfect co-location of aerosol and cloud property retrievals may lead to changes in observed aerosol–cloud–precipitation relationships in precipitating environments.
 In this work, we use a regional-scale model, satellite observations and reanalysis data to investigate how the non-coincidence of aerosol, cloud and precipitation retrievals affects correlations between them. We show that the difference in the aerosol optical depth (AOD)–precipitation relationship between general circulation models (GCMs) and satellite observations can be explained by the wet scavenging of aerosol. Using observations of the development of precipitation from cloud regimes, we show how the influence of wet scavenging can obscure possible aerosol influences on precipitation from convective clouds. This obscuring of aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions by wet scavenging suggests that even if GCMs contained a perfect representation of aerosol influences on convective clouds, the difficulty of separating the "clear-sky" aerosol from the "all-sky" aerosol in GCMs may prevent them from reproducing the correlations seen in satellite data.},

	abstract = {The two-way transition between closed and open cellular convection is addressed in an idealized cloud-resolving modeling framework. A series of cloud-resolving simulations shows that the transition between closed and open cellular states is asymmetrical and characterized by a rapid ("runaway") transition from the closed- to the open-cell state but slower recovery to the closed-cell state. Given that precipitation initiates the closed–open cell transition and that the recovery requires a suppression of the precipitation, we apply an ad hoc time-varying drop concentration to initiate and suppress precipitation. We show that the asymmetry in the two-way transition occurs even for very rapid drop concentration replenishment. The primary barrier to recovery is the loss in turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) associated with the loss in cloud water (and associated radiative cooling) and the vertical stratification of the boundary layer during the open-cell period. In transitioning from the open to the closed state, the system faces the task of replenishing cloud water fast enough to counter precipitation losses, such that it can generate radiative cooling and TKE. It is hampered by a stable layer below cloud base that has to be overcome before water vapor can be transported more efficiently into the cloud layer. Recovery to the closed-cell state is slower when radiative cooling is inefficient such as in the presence of free tropospheric clouds or after sunrise, when it is hampered by the absorption of shortwave radiation. Tests suggest that recovery to the closed-cell state is faster when the drizzle is smaller in amount and of shorter duration, i.e., when the precipitation causes less boundary layer stratification. Cloud-resolving model results on recovery rates are supported by simulations with a simple predator–prey dynamical system analogue. It is suggested that the observed closing of open cells by ship effluent likely occurs when aerosol intrusions are large, when contact comes prior to the heaviest drizzle in the early morning hours, and when the free troposphere is cloud free.},

Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.
Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

We draw in particular on the insights and new analyses emerging from the Theme Issue on ‘African rainforests: past, present and future’ of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. A combination of features characterize the African rainforest biome, including a history of climate variation; forest expansion and retreat; a long history of human interaction with the biome; a relatively low plant species diversity but large tree biomass; a historically exceptionally high animal biomass that is now being severely hunted down; the dominance of selective logging; small-scale farming and bushmeat hunting as the major forms of direct human pressure; and, in Central Africa, the particular context of mineral- and oil-driven economies that have resulted in unusually low rates of deforestation and agricultural activity. We conclude by discussing how this combination of factors influences the prospects for African forests in the twenty-first century.},

It is designed to require minimal configuration from the system administrator and, when used in conjunction with a suitable client tool, provides end users with an interactive means for visualizing data without the need to download large files or interpret complex metadata. It is also used as a “bridging” tool providing interoperability between the environmental science community and users of geographic information systems. ncWMS implements a number of extensions to the WMS standard in order to fulfil some common scientific requirements, including the ability to generate plots representing timeseries and vertical sections. We discuss these extensions and their impact upon present and future interoperability. We discuss the conceptual mapping between the WMS data model and the data models used by gridded data formats, highlighting areas in which the mapping is incomplete or ambiguous. We discuss the architecture of the system and particular technical innovations of note, including the algorithms used for fast data reading and image generation. ncWMS has been widely adopted within the environmental data community and we discuss some of the ways in which the software is integrated within data infrastructures and portals.},

Methodologies developed to analyze CloudSat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations are employed to investigate the cloud-to-precipitation processes and are applied to model results for comparisons with corresponding statistics from the observations. Three precipitation categories of no precipitation, drizzle, and rain are defined according to nonattenuated near-surface radar reflectivity, and their fractional occurrences and the probability of precipitation are investigated as a function of cloud properties such as droplet size, optical thickness, droplet number concentration, and liquid water path. The comparisons reveal how the models are qualitatively similar to, but quantitatively different from, observations in terms of cloud-to-rainwater conversion processes. Statistics from one model reveal a much faster formation of rain than observed, with drizzle occurrence being much less frequent, whereas statistics from the other model illustrate rain formation closer to satellite observations but still faster formation of drizzle water. Vertical profiles of radar reflectivity that are rescaled as a function of in-cloud optical depth and classified according to particle size are also compared. The results show that each model indicates systematically faster formation of rain and drizzle, respectively, than observed in vertical profiles although they indicate that the cloud-to-rain transitions are qualitatively similar to observations. These results characterize the model behavior in terms of warm cloud microphysics and then point to a possible area of model improvement for more realistic representation of warm rain formation processes.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.},

	abstract = {A cloud object partitioning algorithm is developed to provide a widely useful database of deep convective clouds. It takes contiguous CloudSat cloudy regions and identifies various length scales of clouds from a tropical, oceanic subset of data. The methodology identifies a level above which anvil characteristics become important by analyzing the cloud object shape. Below this level in what is termed the pedestal region, convective cores are identified based on reflectivity maxima. Identifying these regions allows for the assessment of length scales of the anvil and pedestal of deep convective clouds. Cloud objects are also appended with certain environmental quantities from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Simple geospatial and temporal assessments show that the cloud object technique agrees with standard observations of local frequency of deep convective cloudiness. Deep convective clouds over tropical oceans play important roles in Earth's climate system. The newly developed data set is used to evaluate the response of tropical, deep convective clouds to sea surface temperature (SST). Several previously proposed responses are examined: the Fixed Anvil Temperature Hypothesis, the Iris Hypothesis, and the Thermostat Hypothesis. When the data are analyzed per cloud object, increasing SST is found to be associated with increased anvil thickness, decreased anvil width, and cooler cloud top temperatures. Implications for the corresponding hypotheses are discussed. A new response suggesting that the base temperature of deep convective anvils remains approximately constant with increasing SSTs is introduced. These cloud dependencies on SST are integrated to form a more comprehensive theory for deep convective anvil responses to SST.},

	abstract = {Black carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr−1 in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m−2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m−2. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m−2. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m−2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m−2. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m−2, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (−0.50 to +1.08) W m−2 during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (−0.06 W m−2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of −1.45 to +1.29 W m−2). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates.},

Such a tree subdivides space into rectangular cells through the recursive application  of some splitting rule. The choice of splitting rule affects the shape of cells and the structure  of the resulting tree. It has been shown that an important element in achieving efficient query  times for approximate queries is that each cell should be fat, meaning that the ratio of its longest  side to shortest side (its aspect ratio) should be bounded. Subdivisions with fat cells satisfy a  property called the packing constraint, which bounds the number of disjoint cells of a given size  that can overlap a ball of a given radius.

We assess the errors incurred due to ignoring temporal sampling and show they are of similar magnitude as (but smaller than) actual model errors (20–60 \%).


 Using temporal sampling from remote sensing datasets (the satellite imager MODIS and the ground-based sun photometer network AERONET) and three different global aerosol models, we compare annual and monthly averages of full model data to sampled model data. Our results show that sampling errors as large as 100 \% in AOT (Aerosol Optical Thickness), 0.4 in AE (Ångström Exponent) and 0.05 in SSA (Single Scattering Albedo) are possible. Even in daily averages, sampling errors can be significant. More-over these sampling errors are often correlated over long distances giving rise to artificial contrasts between pristine and polluted events and regions. Additionally, we provide evidence that suggests that models will underestimate these errors. To prevent sampling errors, model data should be temporally collocated to the observations before any analysis is made.


 We also discuss how this work has consequences for in-situ measurements (e.g. aircraft campaigns or surface measurements) in model evaluation.},

This study presents the first application of Deep Learning techniques as alternative methodology for climate extreme events detection. Deep neural networks are able to learn high-level representations of a broad class of patterns from labeled data.

In an initial assessment simulated global distributions for mass and mid-visible aerosol optical thickness (aot) were compared among 20 different modules. Model diversity was also explored in the context of previous comparisons. For the component combined aot general agreement has improved for the annual global mean. At 0.11 to 0.14, simulated aot values are at the lower end of global averages suggested by remote sensing from ground (AERONET ca. 0.135) and space (satellite composite ca. 0.15). More detailed comparisons, however, reveal that larger differences in regional distribution and significant differences in compositional mixture remain. Of particular concern are large model diversities for contributions by dust and carbonaceous aerosol, because they lead to significant uncertainty in aerosol absorption (aab). Since aot and aab, both, influence the aerosol impact on the radiative energy-balance, the aerosol (direct) forcing uncertainty in modeling is larger than differences in aot might suggest. New diagnostic approaches are proposed to trace model differences in terms of aerosol processing and transport: These include the prescription of common input (e.g. amount, size and injection of aerosol component emissions) and the use of observational capabilities from ground (e.g. measurements networks) or space (e.g. correlations between aerosol and clouds).},

It is thus also referred to as generative model. We assume that only a finite number of parameters are of interest and allow the generative process to be very general; it may be a noisy nonlinear dynamical system with an unrestricted number of hidden variables. This weak assumption is useful for devising realistic models but it renders statistical inference very difficult. The main challenge is the intractability of the likelihood function. Several likelihood-free inference methods have been proposed which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small. A major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost is largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a strategy which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The strategy is implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the inference through a reduction in the number of required simulations by several orders of magnitude.},

The main contribution of our work is the construction of an inter-domain inducing point approximation that is well-tailored to the convolutional kernel. This allows us to gain the generalisation benefit of a convolutional kernel, together with fast but accurate posterior inference. We investigate several variations of the convolutional kernel, and apply it to MNIST and CIFAR-10, which have both been known to be challenging for Gaussian processes. We also show how the marginal likelihood can be used to find an optimal weighting between convolutional and RBF kernels to further improve performance. We hope that this illustration of the usefulness of a marginal likelihood will help automate discovering architectures in larger models.},

We validate the method on a well-established climatic teleconnection connecting the tropical Pacific with extra-tropical temperatures and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real data. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative techniques in detection power from small to large-scale datasets and opens up entirely new possibilities to discover causal networks from time series across a range of research fields.},

They have been applied to both regression and non-linear dimensionality reduction, and offer desirable properties such as uncertainty estimates, robustness to over-fitting, and principled ways for tuning hyper-parameters. However the scalability of these models to big datasets remains an active topic of research. We introduce a novel re-parametrisation of variational inference for sparse GP regression and latent variable models that allows for an efficient distributed algorithm. This is done by exploiting the decoupling of the data given the inducing points to re-formulate the evidence lower bound in a Map-Reduce setting. We show that the inference scales well with data and computational resources, while preserving a balanced distribution of the load among the nodes. We further demonstrate the utility in scaling Gaussian processes to big data. We show that GP performance improves with increasing amounts of data in regression (on flight data with 2 million records) and latent variable modelling (on MNIST). The results show that GPs perform better than many common models often used for big data.},

Modeling physics system, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

	title = {Online learning as a way to tackle instabilities and biases in neural network parameterizations},
	abstract = {Over the last couple of years, machine learning parameterizations have emerged as a potential way to improve the representation of sub-grid processes in atmospheric models. All previous studies created a training dataset from a high-resolution simulation, fitted a machine learning algorithms to that dataset, and then plugged the trained algorithm into an atmospheric model. The resulting online simulations were frequently plagued by instabilities and biases. Here, I propose online learning as a way to combat these issues. In online learning, the pretrained machine learning parameterization, specifically a neural network, is run in parallel with a high-resolution simulation which is kept in sync with the neural network-driven atmospheric model through constant forcing. This enables the neural network to learn from the tendencies that the high-resolution simulation would produce if it experienced the atmospheric states the neural network creates. The concept is illustrated using the Lorenz 96 model, where online learning is able to recover the "true" parameterizations. Then I present detailed algorithms for implementing online learning in the 3D cloud-resolving model and super-parameterization frameworks. Finally, I discuss outstanding challenges and issues not solved by this approach.},

	abstract = {While the history of machine learning so far encompasses a series of problems posed by researchers and algorithms that learn their solutions, an important question is whether the problems themselves can be generated by the algorithm at the same time as they are being solved. Such a process would in effect build its own diverse and expanding curricula, and the solutions to problems at various stages would become stepping stones towards solving even more challenging problems later in the process. The Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm introduced in this paper does just that: it pairs the generation of environmental challenges and the optimization of agents to solve those challenges. It simultaneously explores many different paths through the space of possible problems and solutions and, critically, allows these stepping-stone solutions to transfer between problems if better, catalyzing innovation. The term open-ended signifies the intriguing potential for algorithms like POET to continue to create novel and increasingly complex capabilities without bound. The results show that POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved by direct optimization alone, or even through a direct, single-path curriculum-based control algorithm introduced to highlight the critical role of open-endedness in solving ambitious challenges. The ability to transfer solutions from one environment to another proves essential to unlocking the full potential of the system as a whole, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of fortuitous stepping stones. We hope that POET will inspire a new push towards open-ended discovery across many domains, where algorithms like POET can blaze a trail through their interesting possible manifestations and solutions.},

In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, \$f(x) = x {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}text\{sigmoid\}({\textbackslash}beta x)\$, which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9{\textbackslash}\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6{\textbackslash}\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

In this work, we propose a novel nonlinear technique for calibrating from simulations to experiments, or from low fidelity simulations to high fidelity simulations, via "transfer learning". Transfer learning is a commonly used technique in the machine learning community, in which models trained on one task are partially retrained to solve a separate, but related task, for which there is a limited quantity of data. We introduce the idea of hierarchical transfer learning, in which neural networks trained on low fidelity models are calibrated to high fidelity models, then to experimental data. This technique essentially bootstraps the calibration process, enabling the creation of models which predict high fidelity simulations or experiments with minimal computational cost. We apply this technique to a database of ICF simulations and experiments carried out at the Omega laser facility. Transfer learning with deep neural networks enables the creation of models that are more predictive of Omega experiments than simulations alone. The calibrated models accurately predict future Omega experiments, and are used to search for new, optimal implosion designs.},

	abstract = {The largest uncertainty in the historical radiative forcing of climate is caused by the interaction of aerosols with clouds. Historical forcing is not a directly measurable quantity, so reliable assessments depend on the development of global models of aerosols and clouds that are well constrained by observations. However, there has been no systematic assessment of how reduction in the uncertainty of global aerosol models will feed through to the uncertainty in the predicted forcing. We use a global model perturbed parameter ensemble to show that tight observational constraint of aerosol concentrations in the model has a relatively small effect on the aerosol-related uncertainty in the calculated forcing between preindustrial and present-day periods. One factor is the low sensitivity of present-day aerosol to natural emissions that determine the preindustrial aerosol state. However, the major cause of the weak constraint is that the full uncertainty space of the model generates a large number of model variants that are equally acceptable compared to present-day aerosol observations. The narrow range of aerosol concentrations in the observationally constrained model gives the impression of low aerosol model uncertainty. However, these multiple "equifinal" models predict a wide range of forcings. To make progress, we need to develop a much deeper understanding of model uncertainty and ways to use observations to constrain it. Equifinality in the aerosol model means that tuning of a small number of model processes to achieve model-observation agreement could give a misleading impression of model robustness.},

The design presented in this article can operate between 0.1 and 3\% supersaturation, at sampling rates sufficient for airborne operation. The design constitutes a cylindrical continuous-flow thermal-gradient diffusion chamber employing a novel technique of generating a supersaturation: by establishing a constant streamwise temperature gradient so that the difference in water vapor and thermal diffusivity yield a quasi-uniform centerline supersaturation. Our design maximizes the growth rate of activated droplets, thereby enhancing the performance of the instrument. The temperature gradient and the flow through the column control the supersaturation and may be modified to retrieve CCN spectra. The principle of the CCN instrument was validated in controlled laboratory experiments at different operating conditions using a monodisperse aerosols with known composition and size. These experiments yield sharp activation curves, even for those kinetically limited particles that have not exceeded their critical diameter. The performance of the CCN instrument was also assessed using polydisperse laboratory-generated aerosol of known composition and size distributions similar to ambient particulate matter. In all tests, the measured CCN concentrations compared well with predicted values and highlight the instrument's ability to measure CCN at various size distributions. The full potential of the new design has yet to be explored; however, model simulations suggest that direct measurements in the climatically important range of supersaturations of less than 0.1\% (certainly down to 0.07\%) are possible. The new instrument clearly offers a unique level of design simplicity, robustness, and flexilibity (temperature control, large range of supersaturations without flow reversal, and multiple configurations for same supersaturation) necessary for atmospheric studies.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional interactive aerosol-climate model has been developed and used to study the climatic impact of black carbon (BC) aerosols. When compared with the model's natural variability, significant global-scale changes caused by BC aerosols occurred in surface latent and sensible heat flux, surface net long-wave radiative flux, planetary boundary layer height, convective precipitation (all negative), and low-cloud coverage (positive), all closely related to the hydrological cycle. The most significant regional change caused by BC revealed in this study is in precipitation that occurs in the tropics (shift of precipitation center in the ITCZ) and in the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (change in snow depth). Influenced by BC caused changes in cloud cover and surface albedo, the interactive model provides smaller positive all-sky forcing at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and larger negative forcing at the surface than the offline diagnostics (the direct forcings). The actual solar radiative forcings by BC derived from the interactive model also exhibit significant interannual variations that are up to 4 times as large as their means. Based on the revealed changes in cloud radiative forcing by BC, a non-Twomey-Albrecht indirect forcing by BC that alters radiative budgets by changing cloud cover via thermodynamics rather than microphysics is also defined. It has been demonstrated that with an absolute amount more than 2 times higher than that of the TOA forcing, the surface forcing by BC is a very important factor in analyzing the climatic impact of BC. The result of this study suggests that with a constant annual emission of 14 TgC, BC aerosols do not cause a significant change in global-mean surface temperature. The calculated surface temperature change is determined by a subtle balance among changes in surface energy budget as well as in the hydrological cycle, all caused by BC forcing and often compensate each other. The result of this study shows that the influences of BC aerosols on climate and environment are more significant in regional scale than in global scale. Important feedbacks between BC radiative effects and climate dynamics revealed in this study suggest the importance of using interactive aerosol-climate models to address the issues related to the climate impacts of aerosols.},

It has been run for the period 1860–2100 in support of the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Anthropogenic aerosol emissions peak between 1980 and 2020, resulting in a present-day all-sky top of the atmosphere aerosol forcing of −1.6 and −1.4 W m−2 with and without ammonium nitrate aerosols, respectively, for the sum of direct and first indirect aerosol forcings. Aerosol forcing becomes significantly weaker in the 21st century, being weaker than −0.5 W m−2 in 2100 without nitrate. However, nitrate aerosols become the dominant species in Europe and Asia and decelerate the decrease in global mean aerosol forcing. Considering nitrate aerosols makes aerosol radiative forcing 2–4 times stronger by 2100 depending on the representative concentration pathway, although this impact is lessened when changes in the oxidation properties of the atmosphere are accounted for. Anthropogenic aerosol residence times increase in the future in spite of increased precipitation, as cloud cover and aerosol-cloud interactions decrease in tropical and midlatitude regions. Deposition of fossil fuel black carbon onto snow and ice surfaces peaks during the 20th century in the Arctic and Europe but keeps increasing in the Himalayas until the middle of the 21st century. Results presented here confirm the importance of aerosols in influencing the Earth's climate, albeit with a reduced impact in the future, and suggest that nitrate aerosols will partially replace sulphate aerosols to become an important anthropogenic species in the remainder of the 21st century.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate the ability of a single-wavelength backscatter lidar to provide information on the uptake of water vapor by aerosol in a well-mixed, cloud-capped, boundary layer. Aerosol hydration has important consequences for the effect of aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget. A vertically pointing, airborne lidar is used to measure vertical profiles of aerosol backscatter beneath a stratocumulus cloud deck. In situ aircraft thermodynamic measurements are used to derive simultaneous profiles of relative humidity (RH) under the assumption that the boundary layer is well mixed. The change in backscatter is derived as a function of relative humidity over the range ∼85\% RH to ∼98.5\% RH. In situ measurements of the aerosol size distribution and composition are used to calculate the expected enhancement in backscatter due to equilibrium uptake of water vapor. Comparison between lidar backscatter enhancement as a function of RH and that derived from the in situ aerosol size distribution and composition measurements shows good agreement. Conditional sampling on strong updrafts/downdrafts indicates that aerosol backscatter tends to be higher in downdrafts than it is in updrafts for the same RH range. This is consistent with the concept of inertia of the larger hydrated particles to growth/evaporation at short timescales but may also be due to a bias in the way that lidar-derived cloud base is interpreted in updrafts versus downdrafts. Calculations of enhancement in total scatter due to water vapor uptake with enhancement in backscatter suggest that the effects agree to within ∼20\% of one another for RH {\textless} ∼95\% but that they differ significantly for RH {\textgreater} 95\%.},

Transfer, production, and removal of cloud-borne aerosol number and mass by cloud droplet activation, collision scavenging, aqueous-phase sulfate production, freezing, melting, evaporation, sublimation, and precipitation formation are taken into account. The model performance is demonstrated and validated with observations of the evolution of total and interstitial aerosol concentrations and size distributions during three different mixed-phase cloud events at the alpine high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch (Switzerland). Although the single-column simulations cannot be compared one-to-one with the observations, the governing processes in the evolution of the cloud and aerosol parameters are captured qualitatively well. High scavenged fractions are found during the presence of liquid water, while the release of particles during the Bergeron-Findeisen process results in low scavenged fractions after cloud glaciation.

The measurements were conducted in regions influenced by industrial and urban sources. Observations show significant local variability of CCN activity (CCN/CN from 0.1 to 0.5 at s = 0.43\%), while variability is less significant across regional scales (∼100 km × 100 km; CCN/CN is ∼0.1 at s = 0.43\%). CCN activity can increase with increasing plume age and oxygenated organic fraction. CCN measurements are compared to predictions for a number of mixing state and composition assumptions. Mixing state assumptions that assumed internally mixed aerosol predict CCN concentrations well. Assuming organics are as hygroscopic as ammonium sulfate consistently overpredicted CCN concentrations. On average, the water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) fraction is 60 ± 14\% of the organic aerosol. We show that CCN closure can be significantly improved by incorporating knowledge of the WSOC fraction with a prescribed organic hygroscopicity parameter (κ = 0.16 or effective κ ∼ 0.3). This implies that the hygroscopicity of organic mass is primarily a function of the WSOC fraction. The overall aerosol hygroscopicity parameter varies between 0.08 and 0.88. Furthermore, droplet activation kinetics are variable and 60\% of particles are smaller than the size characteristic of rapid droplet growth.},

Biomass burning and pollution plumes identified from trace gas measurements were evaluated for their aerosol physiochemical and optical signatures. Measurements of soluble ionic mass and refractory black carbon (BC) mass, inferred from light absorption, were combined with volatility to identify organic carbon at 400°C (VolatileOC) and the residual or refractory organic carbon, RefractoryOC. This approach characterized distinct constituent mass fractions present in biomass burning and pollution plumes every 5–10 min. Biomass burning, pollution and dust aerosol could be stratified by their combined spectral scattering and absorption properties. The “nonplume” regional aerosol exhibited properties dominated by pollution characteristics near the surface and biomass burning aloft. VolatileOC included most water-soluble organic carbon. RefractoryOC dominated enhanced shortwave absorption in plumes from Alaskan and Canadian forest fires. The mass absorption efficiency of this RefractoryOC was about 0.63 m2 g−1 at 470 nm and 0.09 m2 g−1 at 530 nm. Concurrent measurements of the humidity dependence of scattering, γ, revealed the OC component to be only weakly hygroscopic resulting in a general decrease in γ with increasing OC mass fractions. Under ambient humidity conditions, the systematic relations between physiochemical properties and γ lead to a well-constrained dependency on the absorption per unit dry mass for these plume types that may be used to challenge remotely sensed and modeled optical properties.},

Vertical profiles of aerosol concentration, size distribution, and light scattering were used to characterize vertical structure from 70°S to 70°N. The in situ data are placed in the context of meteorological regimes over the Pacific as well as processes associated with particle formation, growth, and evolution, and include dust, pollution, sea salt, sulfates, and clean cloud–processed air. The Tropics commonly have low aerosol mass but very high number concentrations in the upper free troposphere (FT) that appear to form from sulfuric acid (nucleation) in convective regions and near cloud edges. These age and subside to become effective cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) when mixed into the marine boundary layer. Fewer number but larger aerosol are more evident in the midlatitude FT. These can often be internally mixed and with a nonvolatile core indicative of black carbon with volatile components (sulfate, organics, etc.). In the North Pacific springtime a combustion-derived aerosol is frequently found associated with the same meteorology that transports “dust events.” Both constituents may dominate the scattering and absorption properties of the aerosol even though the increase in large dust particles in such events generally dominates the mass. The FT in the subtropics tends to exhibit frequent and marked transitions and mixing between these clean and continental aerosol types.},

It is hypothesized that when convection is forced by island surface heating, aerosols from the mostly forested island surface are lofted into the clouds resulting in the observed high concentration of aerosols and the high concentration of small cloud droplets. When trying to understand the impact of these surface based aerosols on precipitation, however, observed differences in cloud layer moisture add to the complexity. The WRF model with the aerosol-aware Thompson microphysics scheme is used to study six idealized scenarios of thermally driven island convection: with and without a surface aerosol source, with a relatively dry cloud layer and with a moist cloud layer, and with no wind and with a weak background wind. It is found that at least a weak background wind is needed to ensure Dominica-relevant results, and that the effect of cloud layer moisture on cloud and precipitation formation dominates over the effect of aerosol. The aerosol impact is limited by the dominance of precipitation formation through accretion. Nevertheless, in order to match observed cloud microphysical properties and precipitation, both a relatively dry cloud layer and a surface aerosol source are needed. The impact of a surface aerosol source on precipitation is strongest when the environment is not conducive to cloud growth.},

In the first, aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions and dynamical feedbacks were investigated to study the formation and evolution of open and closed cellular structures separately. In this paper, coexisting open and closed cells and how they influence one another are examined in a model domain of 180 × 60 × 1.5 km3. Simulations show that gradients in aerosol at the open–closed-cell boundary cause gradients in precipitation that generate a mesoscale circulation. The circulation promotes precipitation in the polluted closed cells but suppresses it in open cells by transporting water vapor to the closed-cell regime and carrying drier air and aerosol back to the open cells. The strength of this circulation depends on the contrast in precipitation under clean and polluted conditions at the boundary. Ship plumes emitted into clean, precipitating regions, simulated as a special case of a clean–polluted boundary, develop a similar circulation. Drizzle in the ship track is first suppressed by the increase in aerosol particles but later recovers and becomes even stronger because the local circulation enhances liquid water path owing to the convergence of water vapor from the region adjacent to the track. This circulation modifies the transport and mixing of ship plumes and enhances their dispersal. Finally, results show that whereas ship emissions do increase cloud albedo in regions of open cells, even the addition of very large aerosol concentrations cannot transform an open cellular structure to a closed one, for the case considered.},

To seek a preliminary answer, the authors introduce a model consisting of 40 ordinary differential equations, with the dependent variables representing values of some atmospheric quantity at 40 sites spaced equally about a latitude circle. The equations contain quadratic, linear, and constant terms representing advection, dissipation, and external forcing. Numerical integration indicates that small errors (differences between solutions) tend to double in about 2 days. Localized errors tend to spread eastward as they grow, encircling the globe after about 14 days. In the experiments presented, 20 consecutive sites lie over the ocean and 20 over land. A particular solution is chosen as the true weather. Every 6 h observations are made, consisting of the true weather plus small random errors, at every land site, and at one ocean site to be selected by the strategy being considered. An analysis is then made, consisting of observations where observations are made and previously made 6-h forecasts elsewhere. Forecasts are made for each site at ranges from 6 h to 10 days. In all forecasts, a slightly weakened external forcing is used to simulate the model error. This process continues for 5 years, and mean-square forecast errors at each site at each range are accumulated. Strategies that attempt to locate the site where the current analysis, as made without a supplementary observation, is most greatly in error are found to perform better than those that seek the oceanic site to which a chosen land site is most sensitive at a chosen range. Among the former are strategies based on the “breeding” method, a variant of singular vectors, and ensembles of “replicated” observations; the last of these outperforms the others. The authors speculate as to the applicability of these findings to models with more realistic dynamics or without extensive regions devoid of routine observations, and to the real world.},

Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best‐fitting parameter values.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the number of studies that investigate aerosol–cloud interactions has increased considerably. Although tremendous progress has been made to improve the understanding of basic physical mechanisms of aerosol–cloud interactions and reduce their uncertainties in climate forcing, there is still poor understanding of 1) some of the mechanisms that interact with each other over multiple spatial and temporal scales, 2) the feedbacks between microphysical and dynamical processes and between local-scale processes and large-scale circulations, and 3) the significance of cloud–aerosol interactions on weather systems as well as regional and global climate. This review focuses on recent theoretical studies and important mechanisms on aerosol–cloud interactions and discusses the significances of aerosol impacts on radiative forcing and precipitation extremes associated with different cloud systems. The authors summarize the main obstacles preventing the science from making a leap—for example, the lack of concurrent profile measurements of cloud dynamics, microphysics, and aerosols over a wide region on the observation side and the large variability of cloud microphysics parameterizations resulting in a large spread of modeling results on the modeling side. Therefore, large efforts are needed to escalate understanding. Future directions should focus on obtaining concurrent measurements of aerosol properties and cloud microphysical and dynamic properties over a range of temporal and spatial scales collected over typical climate regimes and closure studies, as well as improving understanding and parameterizations of cloud microphysics such as ice nucleation, mixed-phase properties, and hydrometeor size and fall speed.},

	abstract = {Convective cold pool events in (semi) arid areas have significant impacts on their environment. They reach horizontal extents of up to several hundred kilometers and the associated turbulence and shear can cause dust emissions and threaten aviation safety. Furthermore, cold pools play a major role in the organization of deep convection and in horizontal moisture transport. They have even been proposed to have impacts on larger-scale monsoon dynamics. Cold pools are not well represented in models using a convective parameterization. To test and improve these models, it is necessary to reliably detect cold pool occurrence from standard observational data. Former studies, however, focused on single cases or short time periods. Here, an objective and automated method for the generation of multiyear climatologies of cold-pool events is presented. The algorithm combines standard surface observations with satellite microwave data. Representativeness of stations and influence of their spatial density are addressed by comparison to a satellite-only climatology. Applying this algorithm to data from automatic weather stations and manned synoptic stations in and south of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and Algeria reveals the frequent occurrence of cold pool events in this region. On the order of six cold-pool events per month are detected from May to September when the Saharan heat low is in its northernmost position. The events tend to cluster into several-days-long convectively active periods, often with strong events on consecutive days. The algorithm is flexible enough to be applied in comparable regions around the world.},

Most field studies of atmospheric aerosols over continents are influenced by atmospheric vapours of anthropogenic origin (for example, ref. 2) and, in consequence, aerosol processes in pristine, terrestrial environments remain poorly understood. The Amazon rainforest is one of the few continental regions where aerosol particles and their precursors can be studied under near-natural conditions3,4,5, but the origin of small aerosol particles that grow into cloud condensation nuclei in the Amazon boundary layer remains unclear6,7,8. Here we present aircraft- and ground-based measurements under clean conditions during the wet season in the central Amazon basin. We find that high concentrations of small aerosol particles (with diameters of less than 50 nanometres) in the lower free troposphere are transported from the free troposphere into the boundary layer during precipitation events by strong convective downdrafts and weaker downward motions in the trailing stratiform region. This rapid vertical transport can help to maintain the population of particles in the pristine Amazon boundary layer, and may therefore influence cloud properties and climate under natural conditions.},

	abstract = {A phase-separation mechanism is proposed for the dominance of the surface tension effect over the solute effect in the observed activation of ultrafine cloud condensation nuclei. Atmospheric cloud droplets form through the spontaneous nucleation of water vapour onto aerosol particles, which act as cloud condensation nuclei. The activation of these nuclei depends on the interplay between the Raoult effect, whereby activation potential increases with decreasing water activity or increasing solute concentration, and the Kelvin effect, whereby activation potential decreases with decreasing droplet size or increases with decreasing surface tension. Surface tension may be lowered by surfactants, amphiphilic (water- and fat-loving) compounds that adsorb at the water–air interface. It is expected that surface tension lowering is rendered ineffective by a simultaneous reduction in the Raoult effect, driven by the displacement of surfactant molecules from the bulk droplet to the droplet–vapour interface. Here the authors find that in ambient air the surface tension lowering can prevail over the Raoult effect as a result of liquid–liquid phase separation, leading to substantial increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. The spontaneous growth of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) into cloud droplets under supersaturated water vapour conditions is described by classic Köhler theory1,2. This spontaneous activation of CCN depends on the interplay between the Raoult effect, whereby activation potential increases with decreasing water activity or increasing solute concentration, and the Kelvin effect, whereby activation potential decreases with decreasing droplet size or increases with decreasing surface tension, which is sensitive to surfactants1. Surface tension lowering caused by organic surfactants, which diminishes the Kelvin effect, is expected to be negated by a concomitant reduction in the Raoult effect, driven by the displacement of surfactant molecules from the droplet bulk to the droplet–vapour interface3,4. Here we present observational and theoretical evidence illustrating that, in ambient air, surface tension lowering can prevail over the reduction in the Raoult effect, leading to substantial increases in cloud droplet concentrations. We suggest that consideration of liquid–liquid phase separation, leading to complete or partial engulfing of a hygroscopic particle core by a hydrophobic organic-rich phase, can explain the lack of concomitant reduction of the Raoult effect, while maintaining substantial lowering of surface tension, even for partial surface coverage. Apart from the importance of particle size and composition in droplet activation, we show by observation and modelling that incorporation of phase-separation effects into activation thermodynamics can lead to a CCN number concentration that is up to ten times what is predicted by climate models, changing the properties of clouds. An adequate representation of the CCN activation process is essential to the prediction of clouds in climate models, and given the effect of clouds on the Earth’s energy balance, improved prediction of aerosol–cloud–climate interactions is likely to result in improved assessments of future climate change.},

Much progress has been made in understanding the response of global average precipitation by considering the energy balances of the atmosphere and the surface1,2,3,4,5,6. This energetic perspective reveals that changes in temperature, greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar forcing and cloud feedbacks can all affect the global average rate of precipitation5,7,8,9,10,11. Local precipitation changes have conventionally been analysed using the water vapour budget, but here we show that the energetic approach can be extended to local changes in precipitation by including changes in horizontal energy transport. In simulations of twenty-first century climate change, this energy transport accounts for much of the spatial variability in precipitation change. We show that changes in radiative and surface sensible heat fluxes are a guide to the local precipitation response over land and at large scales, but not at small scales over the ocean, where cloud and water vapour radiative feedbacks dampen the response. The energetic approach described here helps bridge the gap between our understanding of global and regional precipitation changes. It could be applied to better understand the response of regional precipitation to different radiative forcings, including geo-engineering schemes, as well as to understand the differences between the fast and slow responses of regional precipitation to such forcings.},

Recent studies characterizing the effects of climate change on air quality and the broader distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere show significant, but inconsistent results, including the sign of the effect1,2,3. Using a suite of state-of-the-art climate models, we show that climate change is associated with a negative aerosol–climate feedback of −0.02 to −0.09 W m−2 K−1 for direct radiative effects, with much larger values likely for indirect radiative effects. This is related to an increase in most aerosol species, particularly over the tropics and Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes, largely due to a decrease in wet deposition associated with less large-scale precipitation over land. Although simulation of aerosol processes in global climate models possesses uncertainty, we conclude that climate change may increase aerosol burden and surface concentration, which may have implications for future air quality.},

We show that such variable time lags are typical for complex nonlinear systems such as the climate, prohibiting straightforward use of correlation lags to infer causation. However, an insight from dynamical systems theory8 now allows us to circumvent the classical challenges of unravelling causation from multivariate time series. We build on this insight to demonstrate directly from ice-core data that, over glacial–interglacial timescales, climate dynamics are largely driven by internal Earth system mechanisms, including a marked positive feedback effect from temperature variability on greenhouse-gas concentrations.},

	abstract = {Aerosols affect climate by modifying cloud properties through their role as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei, called aerosol-cloud interactions. In most global climate models (GCMs), the aerosol-cloud interactions are represented by empirical parameterisations, in which the mass of cloud liquid water (LWP) is assumed to increase monotonically with increasing aerosol loading. Recent satellite observations, however, have yielded contradictory results: LWP can decrease with increasing aerosol loading. This difference implies that GCMs overestimate the aerosol effect, but the reasons for the difference are not obvious. Here, we reproduce satellite-observed LWP responses using a global simulation with explicit representations of cloud microphysics, instead of the parameterisations. Our analyses reveal that the decrease in LWP originates from the response of evaporation and condensation processes to aerosol perturbations, which are not represented in GCMs. The explicit representation of cloud microphysics in global scale modelling reduces the uncertainty of climate prediction.},

These particles are inherently hygroscopic, that is, they take-up moisture from the air, which affects the extent to which they interact with solar radiation. We demonstrate that the hygroscopic growth of inorganic sea salt is 8–15\% lower than pure sodium chloride, most likely due to the presence of hydrates. We observe an increase in hygroscopic growth with decreasing particle size (for particle diameters {\textless}150 nm) that is independent of the particle generation method. We vary the hygroscopic growth of the inorganic sea salt within a general circulation model and show that a reduced hygroscopicity leads to a reduction in aerosol-radiation interactions, manifested by a latitudinal-dependent reduction of the aerosol optical depth by up to 15\%, while cloud-related parameters are unaffected. We propose that a value of κs=1.1 (at RH=90\%) is used to represent the hygroscopicity of inorganic sea salt particles in numerical models. Sea spray, one of the largest natural aerosol sources, plays an important role in the Earth’s radiative budget.

The quest to constrain climate sensitivity has revealed important insights into the timescales of the climate system response, natural variability and limitations in observations and climate models, but also concerns about the simple concepts underlying climate sensitivity and radiative forcing, which opens avenues to better understand and constrain the climate response to forcing. Estimates of the transient climate response are better constrained by observed warming and are more relevant for predicting warming over the next decades. Newer metrics relating global warming directly to the total emitted CO2 show that in order to keep warming to within 2 °C, future CO2 emissions have to remain strongly limited, irrespective of climate sensitivity being at the high or low end.},

Real-world experimental evidence for this ‘lensing’ effect is scant and conflicting, showing that absorption enhancements can be less than 5\% or as large as 140\%. Here we present simultaneous quantifications of the composition and optical properties of individual atmospheric black-carbon particles. We show that particles with a mass ratio of non-black carbon to black carbon of less than 1.5, which is typical of fresh traffic sources, are best represented as having no absorption enhancement. In contrast, black-carbon particles with a ratio greater than 3, which is typical of biomass-burning emissions, are best described assuming optical lensing leading to an absorption enhancement. We introduce a generalized hybrid model approach for estimating scattering and absorption enhancements based on laboratory and atmospheric observations.

	volume = {1},
	doi = {10.1038/s41612-018-0026-8},
	abstract = {While cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions dominate anthropogenic warming over centuries, temperatures over the coming decades are also strongly affected by short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), complicating the estimation of cumulative emission budgets for ambitious mitigation goals. Using conventional Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) to convert SLCPs to “CO2-equivalent” emissions misrepresents their impact on global temperature. Here we show that peak warming under a range of mitigation scenarios is determined by a linear combination of cumulative CO2 emissions to the time of peak warming and non-CO2 radiative forcing immediately prior to that time. This may be understood by expressing aggregate non-CO2 forcing as cumulative CO2 forcing-equivalent (CO2-fe) emissions. We show further that contributions to CO2-fe emissions are well approximated by a new usage of GWP, denoted GWP*, which relates cumulative CO2 emissions to date with the current rate of emission of SLCPs. GWP* accurately indicates the impact of emissions of both long-lived and short-lived pollutants on radiative forcing and temperatures over a wide range of timescales, including under ambitious mitigation when conventional GWPs fail. Measured by GWP*, implementing the Paris Agreement would reduce the expected rate of warming in 2030 by 28\% relative to a No Policy scenario. Expressing mitigation efforts in terms of their impact on future cumulative emissions aggregated using GWP* would relate them directly to contributions to future warming, better informing both burden-sharing discussions and long-term policies and measures in pursuit of ambitious global temperature goals. A new approach allows the temperature forcing of CO2 and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) to be examined under a common cumulative framework. While anthropogenic warming is largely determined by cumulative emissions of CO2, SLCPs—including soot, other aerosols and methane—also play a role. Quantifying their impact on global temperature is, however, distorted by existing methodologies using conventional Global Warming Potentials (GWP) to convert SLCPs to "CO2-equivalent" emissions. A team of international scientists led by Myles Allen at the University of Oxford provide a solution. A modified form of GWP—GWP*, which relates cumulative CO2 emissions with contemporary SLCP emissions—is shown to better represent the future climate forcing of both long- and short-term pollutants. Use of GWP* could improve climate policy design, benefiting mitigation strategies to achieve the Paris Agreement targets.},

	abstract = {Global climate change represents one of the greatest challenges facing society and ecosystems today. It impacts key aspects of everyday life and disrupts ecosystem integrity and function. The exponential growth of climate data combined with Knowledge-Discovery through Data-mining (KDD) promises an unparalleled level of understanding of how the climate system responds to anthropogenic forcing. To date, however, this potential has not been fully realized, in stark contrast to the seminal impacts of KDD in other fields such as health informatics, marketing, business intelligence, and smart city, where big data science contributed to several of the most recent breakthroughs. This disparity stems from the complexity and variety of climate data, as well as the scientific questions climate science brings forth. This perspective introduces the audience to benefits and challenges in mining large climate datasets, with an emphasis on the opportunity of using a KDD process to identify patterns of climatic relevance. The focus is on a particular method, δ-MAPS, stemming from complex network analysis. δ-MAPS is especially suited for investigating local and non-local statistical interrelationships in climate data and here is used is to elucidate both the techniques, as well as the results-interpretation process that allows extracting new insight. This is achieved through an investigation of similarities and differences in the representation of known teleconnections between climate reanalyzes and climate model outputs.},

	abstract = {Aerosol effects on cloud cover and precipitation could affect the global climate but have proven difficult to verify, because cloud and rain amounts are so strongly influenced by local meteorological conditions. Here model and observational evidence is presented that an increase in CCN concentration slightly invigorates mixed-phase convective clouds and narrows tropical convergence and rain bands, while expanding associated cloud cover particularly at mid-levels. A suite of model simulations with various approaches indicates a 4 ± 3.8\% decrease in the rain-to-cloud area ratio per doubling of the CCN concentration, an effect also detected in satellite observations. Idealised numerical experiments suggest the area ratio change is due to the invigoration-induced static stability increase. Although the invigoration and cloud amount changes are much smaller than suggested in some studies, in simulations the latter cool the planet by 0.71 ± 0.25 W/m2 in deep convective regions, suggesting a global effect of order 0.2–0.5 W/m2, per aerosol doubling. The contribution to present-day anthropogenic forcing is even harder to quantify but could compare to that of the direct aerosol radiative forcing. These results indicate a previously unrecognised pathway for aerosols to indirectly cool the climate by altering convective clouds dynamically.},

For global increases of 50\% in emissions of either SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ or NO$_{\textrm{x}}$, or both SO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and NO$_{\textrm{x}}$, we find that globally, annually averaged N80 increase by 9.00, 1.47, or 10.24\% respectively.

The P6 parameterization is able to resolve spatial heterogeneity in new-particle formation and growth that cannot be resolved by any constant assumptions about sub-grid sulphate.

	abstract = {We use the GLOMAP global aerosol model evaluated against observations of surface particulate matter (PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) to better understand the impacts of biomass burning on tropical aerosol. To explore the uncertainty in emissions we use three satellite-derived fire emission datasets (GFED3, GFAS1 and FINN1) in the model, in which tropical fires account for 66\&ndash;84 \% of global particulate emissions from fire. The model underestimates PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations where observations are available over South America and AOD over South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. Underestimation of AOD over tropical regions impacted by biomass burning is consistent with previous studies. Where coincident observations of surface PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ and AOD are available we find a greater model underestimation of AOD than PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ Increasing particulate emissions to improve simulation of AOD can therefore lead to overestimation of surface PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations. With FINN1 emissions increased by a factor of 1.5 the model reasonably simulates PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations in South America and AOD over Southeast Asia, but underestimates AOD over South America and Africa. The model with GFAS1 emissions better matches observed PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ and AOD when emissions are increased by a factor of 3.4. The model with GFED3 emissions scaled by a factor of 1.5 reasonably simulates PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations in South America, but requires a larger scaling factor to capture observed AOD in all regions. The model with GFED3 emissions poorly simulates observed seasonal variability of surface PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ and AOD in regions where small fires dominate, providing independent evidence that GFED3 omits emissions from small fires. Seasonal variability of both PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ and AOD is better simulated by the model using FINN1 and GFAS1 emissions. Detailed observations of the vertical profile of aerosol over biomass burning regions are required to better constrain emissions and modelled AOD.},

The model was evaluated with daily assimilation of AOD for the month of April 2005. Sulfur Transport dEposition Model (STEM), a regional chemical transport model, was used to simulate aerosol distributions at a resolution of 50×50km with a time interval of 3h. Monthly mean Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD along with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD was used in an optimal interpolation assimilation scheme to yield regional distributions of aerosols. The MODIS AOD and aerosol fine mode fraction information (where available) were used in the assimilation technique. The daily assimilation of AOD results shows that the optimal interpolation algorithm is able to significantly improve model aerosol mass prediction skills at the two sites in Asia. Sensitivity studies were also conducted with different assimilation parameters on a daily assimilation scale and these results are discussed. The assimilation results of four-year aerosol fields were used to study the spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols in Asia. Two remote sites, Hanimaadhoo and Gosan were chosen as the case studies to study the outflow from the Indian subcontinent and East Asia. Seasonal and vertical structures of the aerosols are presented at these two sites. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), a factor analytic method was also used to characterize the source profile and source contribution at these two locations. A three-factor solution was able to explain more than 80\% of the variation in the individual species at Hanimaadhoo and 90\% variation of aerosol loadings at Gosan. The four-year averaged PMF model results were able to capture the seasonality of anthropogenic and dust loadings at both these locations. In addition, the PMF model identified the differences in the composition of anthropogenic aerosols over Hanimaadhoo and Gosan reflecting the differences in regional emissions. The PMF derived factors could be used as additional constraints for future assimilation studies.},

	abstract = {Aerosol properties simulated by general circulation models (GCMs) exhibit large uncertainties due to biases in model processes and inaccuracies in aerosol emission inputs. In this work, we propose an offline, constrained optimization based procedure to improve these simulations by assimilating them with observational data. The proposed approach explicitly incorporates the non-negativity constraint on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) which is a key metric to quantify aerosol distributions. The resulting optimization problem is quadratic programming in nature and can be easily solved by available optimization routines. The utility of the approach is demonstrated by performing offline assimilation of GCM simulated aerosol optical properties and radiative forcing over South Asia (40–120 E, 5–40 N), with satellite AOD measurements from two sensors, namely Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) and Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). Uncertainty in observational data used in the assimilation is computed by developing different error bands around regional AOD observations, based on their quality assurance flags. The assimilation, evaluated on monthly and daily scales, compares well with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations as determined by goodness of fit statistics. Assimilation increased both model predicted atmospheric absorption and clear sky radiative forcing by factors consistent with recent estimates in literature. Thus, the constrained assimilation algorithm helps in systematically reducing uncertainties in aerosol simulations.},

	abstract = {Within the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project Aerosol\_cci (2010–2013), algorithms for the production of long-term total column aerosol optical depth (AOD) datasets from European Earth Observation sensors are developed. Starting with eight existing pre-cursor algorithms three analysis steps are conducted to improve and qualify the algorithms: (1) a series of experiments applied to one month of global data to understand several major sensitivities to assumptions needed due to the ill-posed nature of the underlying inversion problem, (2) a round robin exercise of "best" versions of each of these algorithms (defined using the step 1 outcome) applied to four months of global data to identify mature algorithms, and (3) a comprehensive validation exercise applied to one complete year of global data produced by the algorithms selected as mature based on the round robin exercise. The algorithms tested included four using AATSR, three using MERIS and one using PARASOL. This paper summarizes the first step. Three experiments were conducted to assess the potential impact of major assumptions in the various aerosol retrieval algorithms. In the first experiment a common set of four aerosol components was used to provide all algorithms with the same assumptions. The second experiment introduced an aerosol property climatology, derived from a combination of model and sun photometer observations, as a priori information in the retrievals on the occurrence of the common aerosol components. The third experiment assessed the impact of using a common nadir cloud mask for AATSR and MERIS algorithms in order to characterize the sensitivity to remaining cloud contamination in the retrievals against the baseline dataset versions. The impact of the algorithm changes was assessed for one month (September 2008) of data: qualitatively by inspection of monthly mean AOD maps and quantitatively by comparing daily gridded satellite data against daily averaged AERONET sun photometer observations for the different versions of each algorithm globally (land and coastal) and for three regions with different aerosol regimes. The analysis allowed for an assessment of sensitivities of all algorithms, which helped define the best algorithm versions for the subsequent round robin exercise; all algorithms (except for MERIS) showed some, in parts significant, improvement. In particular, using common aerosol components and partly also a priori aerosol-type climatology is beneficial. On the other hand the use of an AATSR-based common cloud mask meant a clear improvement (though with significant reduction of coverage) for the MERIS standard product, but not for the algorithms using AATSR. It is noted that all these observations are mostly consistent for all five analyses (global land, global coastal, three regional), which can be understood well, since the set of aerosol components defined in Sect. 3.1 was explicitly designed to cover different global aerosol regimes (with low and high absorption fine mode, sea salt and dust).},

Previous studies have highlighted two unresolved issues with this model: first, the feedback parameter λ depends on the forcing agent; second, λ varies with time. Here, we investigate the factors controlling R in two atmosphere–slab ocean climate models subjected to a wide range of abrupt climate forcings. It is found that R scales not only with T, but also with the large-scale tropospheric stability S (defined here as the estimated inversion strength area-averaged over ocean regions equatorward of 50∘). Positive S promotes negative R, mainly through shortwave cloud and lapse-rate changes. A refined model of the global energy balance is proposed that accounts for both temperature and stability effects. This refined model quantitatively explains (1) the dependence of climate feedbacks on forcing agent (or equivalently, differences in forcing efficacy), and (2) the time evolution of feedbacks in coupled climate model experiments. Furthermore, a similar relationship between R and S is found in observations compared with models, lending confidence that the refined energy balance model is applicable to the real world.},

	abstract = {Differences in the radiative feedback from clouds account for much of the variation in climate sensitivity amongst General Circulation Models (GCMs). Therefore metrics of model performance which are demonstrated to be relevant to the cloud response to climate change form an important contribution to the overall evaluation of GCMs. In this paper we demonstrate an alternative method for assigning model data to observed cloud regimes obtained from clustering histograms of cloud amount in joint cloud optical depth—cloud top pressure classes. The method removes some of the subjectivity that exists in previous GCM cloud clustering studies. We apply the method to ten GCMs submitted to the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP), evaluate the simulated cloud regimes and analyse the climate change response in the context of these regimes. We also propose two cloud regime metrics, one of which is specifically targeted at assessing GCMs for the purpose of obtaining the global cloud radiative response to climate change. Most of the global variance in the cloud radiative response between GCMs is due to low clouds, with 47\% arising from the stratocumulus regime and 18\% due to the regime characterised by clouds undergoing transition from stratocumulus to cumulus. This result is found to be dominated by two structurally similar GCMs. The shallow cumulus regime, though widespread, has a smaller contribution and reduces the variance. For the stratocumulus and transition regimes, part of the variance results from a large model spread in the radiative properties of the regime in the control simulation. Comparison with observations reveals a systematic bias for both the stratocumulus and transition regimes to be overly reflective. If this bias was corrected with all other aspects of the response unchanged, the variance in the low cloud response would reduce. The response of some regimes with high cloud tops differ between the GCMs. These regimes are simulated too infrequently in a few of the models. If the frequency in the control simulation were more realistic and changes within the regimes were unaltered, the variance in the cloud radiative response from high-top clouds would increase. As a result, use of observations of the mean present-day cloud regimes suggests that whilst improvements in the simulation of the cloud regimes would impact the climate sensitivity, the inter-model variance may not reduce. When the cloud regime metric is calculated for the GCMs analysed here, only one model is on average consistent with observations within their uncertainty (and even this model is not consistent with the observations for all regimes), indicating scope for improvement in the simulation of cloud regimes.},

The new approach considers cloud water and cloud ice as separate prognostic variables. The precipitation formation scheme for warm clouds distinguishes between maritime and continental clouds by considering the cloud droplet number concentration, in addition to the liquid water content. Based on several observational data sets, the cloud droplet number concentration is derived from the sulfate aerosol mass concentration as given from the sulfur cycle simulated by ECHAM. Results obtained with the new scheme are compared to satellite observations and in situ measurements of cloud physical and radiative properties. In general, the standard model ECHAM4 and also PCI capture the overall features, and the simulated results usually lie within the range of observed uncertainty. As compared to ECHAM4, only slight improvements are achieved with the new scheme. For example, the overestimated liquid water path and total cloud cover over convectively active regions are reduced in PCI. On the other hand, some shortcomings of the standard model such as underestimated shortwave cloud forcing over the extratropical oceans of the respective summer hemisphere are more pronounced in PCI.},

	abstract = {We assess the current understanding of the state and behaviour of aerosols under pre-industrial conditions and the importance for climate. Studies show that the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial period calculated by climate models is strongly affected by the abundance and properties of aerosols in the pre-industrial atmosphere. The low concentration of aerosol particles under relatively pristine conditions means that global mean cloud albedo may have been twice as sensitive to changes in natural aerosol emissions under pre-industrial conditions compared to present-day conditions. Consequently, the discovery of new aerosol formation processes and revisions to aerosol emissions have large effects on simulated historical aerosol radiative forcing. We review what is known about the microphysical, chemical, and radiative properties of aerosols in the pre-industrial atmosphere and the processes that control them. Aerosol properties were controlled by a combination of natural emissions, modification of the natural emissions by human activities such as land-use change, and anthropogenic emissions from biofuel combustion and early industrial processes. Although aerosol concentrations were lower in the pre-industrial atmosphere than today, model simulations show that relatively high aerosol concentrations could have been maintained over continental regions due to biogenically controlled new particle formation and wildfires. Despite the importance of pre-industrial aerosols for historical climate change, the relevant processes and emissions are given relatively little consideration in climate models, and there have been very few attempts to evaluate them. Consequently, we have very low confidence in the ability of models to simulate the aerosol conditions that form the baseline for historical climate simulations. Nevertheless, it is clear that the 1850s should be regarded as an early industrial reference period, and the aerosol forcing calculated from this period is smaller than the forcing since 1750. Improvements in historical reconstructions of natural and early anthropogenic emissions, exploitation of new Earth system models, and a deeper understanding and evaluation of the controlling processes are key aspects to reducing uncertainties in future.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols are a primary source of uncertainty in future climate projections. Changes to aerosol concentrations modify cloud radiative properties, radiative fluxes, and precipitation from the microphysical to the global scale. Due to computational constraints, we have been unable to explicitly simulate cloud dynamics in global-scale simulations, leaving key processes, such as convective updrafts, parameterized. This has significantly limited our understanding of aerosol impacts on convective clouds and climate. However, new state-of-the-art climate models are capable of representing these scales. In this study, we used the kilometer-scale ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) Earth system model to explore the global-scale rapid response of clouds and precipitation to an idealized distribution of anthropogenic aerosol via aerosol–cloud (ACI) and aerosol–radiation (ARI) interactions. In our simulations over 30 d, we find that the aerosol impacts on clouds and precipitation exhibit strong regional dependence. The impact of ARI and ACI on clouds in isolation shows some consistent behavior, but the magnitude and additive nature of the effects are regionally dependent. Some regions are dominated by either ACI or ARI, whereas others behaved nonlinearly. This suggests that the findings of isolated case studies from regional simulations may not be globally representative; ARI and ACI cannot be considered independently and should both be interactively represented in modeling studies. We also observe pronounced diurnal cycles in the rapid response of cloud microphysical and radiative properties, which suggests that the usefulness of using polar-orbiting satellites to quantify ACI and ARI may be more limited than presently assumed. The simulations highlight some limitations that need to be considered in future studies. Isolating kilometer-scale aerosol responses from internal variability will require longer averaging periods or ensemble simulations. It would also be beneficial to use interactive aerosols and assess the sensitivity of the conclusions to the cloud microphysics scheme.},

The NMME comprises both real-time, initialized predictions and a substantial research database; both retrospective and real-time forecasts are archived and freely available for research and development. Many U.S.-based and international entities, both private and public, use NMME data for regional or otherwise tailored forecasts. The system’s built-in evolution, with new models gradually replacing older ones, has been demonstrated to gradually improve the skill of 2-m temperature and sea surface temperature, although precipitation prediction remains a difficult problem. This paper reviews some of the NMME-based contributions to seasonal climate prediction research and applications, progress on scientific understanding of seasonal prediction and multimodel ensembles, and new techniques. Several prediction-oriented aspects are explored, including model representation of observed trends and the underprediction of below-average temperature. We discuss potential new directions, such as higher-resolution models, hybrid statistical–dynamical techniques, or prediction of environmental hazards such as coastal flooding and the risk of mosquito-borne diseases.},

This dataset now offers the opportunity to characterize the global 3-D distribution of aerosol as well as seasonal and interannual variations, and confront aerosol models with observations in a way that has not been possible before. With that goal in mind, a monthly global gridded dataset of daytime and nighttime aerosol extinction profiles has been constructed, available as a Level 3 aerosol product. Averaged aerosol profiles for cloud-free and all-sky conditions are reported separately. This 6-yr dataset characterizes the global 3-dimensional distribution of tropospheric aerosol. Vertical distributions are seen to vary with season, as both source strengths and transport mechanisms vary. In most regions, clear-sky and all-sky mean aerosol profiles are found to be quite similar, implying a lack of correlation between high semi-transparent cloud and aerosol in the lower troposphere. An initial evaluation of the accuracy of the aerosol extinction profiles is presented. Detection limitations and the representivity of aerosol profiles in the upper troposphere are of particular concern. While results are preliminary, we present evidence that the monthly-mean CALIOP aerosol profiles provide quantitative characterization of elevated aerosol layers in major transport pathways. Aerosol extinction in the free troposphere in clean conditions, where the true aerosol extinction is typically 0.001 km−1 or less, is generally underestimated, however. The work described here forms an initial global 3-D aerosol climatology which we plan to extend and improve over time.},

A key objective of the aircraft component of this experiment included the identification of source regions for new particles in the remote marine atmosphere. No evidence was found for particle production in the marine boundary layer (MBL), but extensive observations of enhanced layers of “new” particles were found in the free troposphere (FT). These layers were generally found at altitudes that corresponded to nearby cloud top heights and exhibited concentrations that exceeded MBL air by about 1000 to 10,000 cm−3. Many layers were also associated with enhanced concentrations of water vapor and sulfuric acid. Focused cloud experiments demonstrated that these particles were recently formed and originated in the outflow region of clouds preferentially after late morning when photochemical processes had become sufficiently active. The production and growth of these particles were rapid, and they appeared to evolve and merge with a background nuclei spectra on the scale of hours to a day. These measurements in midlatitude postfrontal air undergoing shallow convection indicated that particles were produced in the trailing cloud outflow region as low as 2 km altitude and that the base of this layer extended down to the inversion in the region of postfrontal subsidence. Other ACE 1 measurements made in transit near equatorial convection also revealed small nuclei aloft at altitudes up to 6 km and a trend in decreasing concentrations, in conjunction with steadily increasing size, during descent toward the surface. The concentration and size distributions in this these regions indicate that significant numbers of new nuclei are formed aloft in various cloud outflow regions and that they can provide a source for the MBL aerosol via subsidence. This nucleation appears to be favored when existing surface areas approach or drop below about 5–10 μm2 cm−3.},

The central challenge lies in accurately representing processes that are small in scale yet climatically important, such as turbulence and cloud formation. These processes will not be explicitly resolvable for the foreseeable future, necessitating the use of parameterizations. We propose a balanced approach that leverages the strengths of traditional process-based parameterizations and contemporary artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to model subgrid-scale processes. This strategy employs AI to derive data-driven closure functions from both observational and simulated data, integrated within parameterizations that encode system knowledge and conservation laws. In addition, increasing the resolution to resolve a larger fraction of small-scale processes can aid progress toward improved and interpretable climate predictions outside the observed climate distribution. However, currently feasible horizontal resolutions are limited to O(10km) because higher resolutions would impede the creation of the ensembles that are needed for model calibration and uncertainty quantification, for sampling atmospheric and oceanic internal variability, and for broadly exploring and quantifying climate risks. By synergizing decades of scientific development with advanced AI techniques, our approach aims to significantly boost the accuracy, interpretability, and trustworthiness of climate predictions.},

	abstract = {Trade‐wind clouds exhibit a large diversity of spatial organizations at the mesoscale. Over the tropical western Atlantic, a recent study has visually identified four prominent mesoscale patterns of shallow convection, referred to as flowers, fish, gravel, and sugar. We show that these four patterns can be identified objectively from satellite observations by analyzing the spatial distribution of infrared brightness temperatures. By applying this analysis to 19 years of data, we examine relationships between cloud patterns and large‐scale environmental conditions. This investigation reveals that on daily and interannual timescales, the near‐surface wind speed and the strength of the lower‐tropospheric stability discriminate the occurrence of the different organization patterns. These results, combined with the tight relationship between cloud patterns, low‐level cloud amount, and cloud‐radiative effects, suggest that the mesoscale organization of shallow clouds might change under global warming. The role of shallow convective organization in determining low‐cloud feedback should thus be investigated. Satellite imagery shows that clouds in the trade‐wind regions exhibit a large diversity of patterns. Over the tropical Atlantic close to Barbados, the population of low‐level clouds can organize in different ways, adopting patterns evocatively referred to as “flowers“,“fish” ,“gravel,” and “sugar.” This study shows that these different patterns, originally identified subjectively, can be recognized more objectively from space measurements of infrared radiation. It also shows that the relative occurrence of these different patterns relates to the strength of the trade winds near the ocean surface and to the stability of the lower atmosphere. Finally, it shows that each pattern is associated with a different cloud amount and thus impacts the radiative cooling of the Earth differently. These results suggest that under global warming, the change in environmental conditions might perturb the frequency of different patterns, which might affect the Earth's radiative response to warming in a way that has not been previously considered. Prominent mesoscale patterns of shallow convection are identified from satellite observations Mesoscale patterns exhibit strong relationships with surface wind speed and lower‐tropospheric stability Owing to their differences in low‐cloud fraction, mesoscale patterns exert different impacts on the top‐of‐atmosphere radiation budget},

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery was used to distinguish ship tracks embedded in closed, open, and undefined mesoscale cellular cloud structures. The impact of aerosol on the microphysical cloud properties in both the closed and open cell regimes were consistent with the changes predicted by the Twomey hypothesis. For the macrophysical changes, differences were observed between regimes. In the open cell regime, polluted clouds had significantly higher cloud tops (16\%) and more liquid water (39\%) than nearby unpolluted clouds. However, in the closed cell regime, polluted clouds exhibited no change in cloud top height and had less liquid water (−6\%). Both microphysical (effective radius) and macrophysical (liquid water path) cloud properties contribute to a fractional change in cloud optical depth; in the closed cell regime the microphysical contribution was 3 times larger than the macrophysical contribution. However, the opposite was true in the open cell regime where the macrophysical contribution was nearly 2 times larger than the microphysical contribution because the aerosol probably increased cloud coverage. The results presented here demonstrate key differences aerosols have on the microphysical and macrophysical responses of boundary layer clouds between mesoscale stratocumulus convective regimes.},

Statistical analyses show that previously published conclusions that increasing CN concentrations cause a decrease in minimum cloud top temperature (CTT) at the SGP site through the aerosol convective invigoration effect are unfounded. The CN-CTT relationship is statistically insignificant, while correlations between convective available energy (CAPE), level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), and CN concentration account for most of the change in the CN-CTT positive correlation. Removal of clouds with minimum CTTs {\textgreater} -36°C from the analysis eliminates the CN-CTT correlation. Composited dirty conditions at the SGP have {\textasciitilde}1°C warmer low levels and {\textasciitilde}1°C cooler upper levels than clean conditions. This correlation between aerosol concentrations and thermodynamic profiles may be caused by an increase in regional rainfall preceding deep convective conditions as CN concentration decreases. Increased rainfall can be expected to increase wet deposition of aerosols, cool low-level temperatures, and warm upper level temperatures. The masking of a potential aerosol effect by such small thermodynamic changes implies that the strategy of analyzing subsets of aerosol data by binned meteorological factor values is not a valid method for discerning an aerosol effect in some situations. These findings highlight the need for more careful, detailed, and strategic observations to confidently isolate and quantify an aerosol deep convective invigoration effect.},

Revealing atmospheric teleconnection patterns and understanding their underlying mechanisms is of great importance for weather forecasting in general and extreme-event prediction in particular3,4, especially considering that the characteristics of extreme events have been suggested to change under ongoing anthropogenic climate change5–8. Here we reveal the global coupling pattern of extreme-rainfall events by applying complex-network methodology to high-resolution satellite data and introducing a technique that corrects for multiple-comparison bias in functional networks. We find that the distance distribution of significant connections (P {\textless} 0.005) around the globe decays according to a power law up to distances of about 2,500 kilometres. For longer distances, the probability of significant connections is much higher than expected from the scaling of the power law. We attribute the shorter, power-law-distributed connections to regional weather systems. The longer, super-power-law-distributed connections form a global rainfall teleconnection pattern that is probably controlled by upper-level Rossby waves. We show that extreme-rainfall events in the monsoon systems of south-central Asia, east Asia and Africa are significantly synchronized. Moreover, we uncover concise links between south-central Asia and the European and North American extratropics, as well as the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Analysis of the atmospheric conditions that lead to these teleconnections confirms Rossby waves as the physical mechanism underlying these global teleconnection patterns and emphasizes their crucial role in dynamical tropical–extratropical couplings. Our results provide insights into the function of Rossby waves in creating stable, global-scale dependencies of extreme-rainfall events, and into the potential predictability of associated natural hazards. Complex networks are used to analyse global-scale teleconnections between extreme-rainfall events, revealing a peak in the distance distribution of statistically significant connections at around 10,000 kilometres.},

We apply the radiative kernel technique to transient simulations from a multi-thousand member perturbed physics ensemble of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, comparing distributions of model feedbacks with those taken from the CMIP-3 multi GCM ensemble. Although the range of clear sky longwave feedbacks in the perturbed physics ensemble is similar to that seen in the multi-GCM ensemble, the kernel technique underestimates the net clear-sky feedbacks (or the radiative forcing) in some perturbed models with significantly altered humidity distributions. In addition, the compensating relationship between global mean atmospheric lapse rate feedback and water vapor feedback is found to hold in the perturbed physics ensemble, but large differences in relative humidity distributions in the ensemble prevent the compensation from holding at a regional scale. Both ensembles show a similar range of response of global mean net cloud feedback, but the mean of the perturbed physics ensemble is shifted towards more positive values such that none of the perturbed models exhibit a net negative cloud feedback. The perturbed physics ensemble contains fewer models with strong negative shortwave cloud feedbacks and has stronger compensating positive longwave feedbacks. A principal component analysis used to identify dominant modes of feedback variation reveals that the perturbed physics ensemble produces very different modes of climate response to the multi-model ensemble, suggesting that one may not be used as an analog for the other in estimates of uncertainty in future response. Whereas in the multi-model ensemble, the first order variation in cloud feedbacks shows compensation between longwave and shortwave components, in the perturbed physics ensemble the shortwave feedbacks are uncompensated, possibly explaining the larger range of climate sensitivities observed in the perturbed simulations. Regression analysis suggests that the parameters governing cloud formation, convection strength and ice fall speed are the most significant in altering climate feedbacks. Perturbations of oceanic and sulfur cycle parameters have relatively little effect on the atmospheric feedbacks diagnosed by the kernel technique.},

The BCA mass loading in the Arctic simulated with 3.5-km grid resolution was 4.2-times larger than that simulated with coarse (56-km) grid resolution. Our results also indicated that grid convergence had not occurred on both the contrast between the cloud/cloud free areas and the poleward BCA mass flux, despite the use of the 3.5-km grid resolution.

ML has recently exploded in popularity in many fields, including meteorology. Although ML has been successful in meteorology, it has not been as widely accepted, primarily due to the perception that ML models are “black boxes”, meaning the ML methods are thought to take inputs and provide outputs but not to yield physically interpretable information to the user. This paper introduces and demonstrates multiple MIV techniques for both traditional ML and deep learning, to enable meteorologists to understand what ML models have learned. We discuss permutation-based predictor importance, forward and backwards selection, saliency maps, class-activation maps, backwards optimization, and novelty detection. We apply these methods at multiple spatiotemporal scales to tornado, hail, winter precipitation type, and convective-storm mode. By analyzing on such a wide variety of applications, we intend for this work to demystify the black box of ML, offer insight in applying MIV techniques, and serve as a MIV toolbox for meteorologists and other physical scientists.

	abstract = {The framework of feedback analysis is used to explore the controls on the shape of the probability distribution of global mean surface temperature response to climate forcing. It is shown that ocean heat uptake, which delays and damps the temperature rise, can be represented as a transient negative feedback. This transient negative feedback causes the transient climate change to have a narrower probability distribution than that of the equilibrium climate response (the climate sensitivity). In this sense, climate change is much more predictable than climate sensitivity. The width of the distribution grows gradually over time, a consequence of which is that the larger the climate change being contemplated, the greater the uncertainty is about when that change will be realized. Another consequence of this slow growth is that further efforts to constrain climate sensitivity will be of very limited value for climate projections on societally relevant time scales. Finally, it is demonstrated that the effect on climate predictability of reducing uncertainty in the atmospheric feedbacks is greater than the effect of reducing uncertainty in ocean feedbacks by the same proportion. However, at least at the global scale, the total impact of uncertainty in climate feedbacks is dwarfed by the impact of uncertainty in climate forcing, which in turn is contingent on choices made about future anthropogenic emissions.},

However, its projected warming is highly uncertain and varies substantially across climate models. Here, using outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase six models, we show that Southern Ocean warming during the twenty-first century is linked to the change in amplitude of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Models simulating a larger increase in ENSO amplitude systematically produce a slower Southern Ocean warming; conversely, a smaller increase in ENSO amplitude sees a stronger warming. The asymmetry in amplitude and teleconnection between El Niño and La Niña produce cumulative surface wind anomalies over the southern high latitudes, impacting Southern Ocean heat uptake. The magnitude of inter-model ENSO variations accounts for about 50\% of the uncertainty in the projected Southern Ocean warming. The ocean absorbs atmospheric heat; understanding this process is needed to predict climate change impacts. Model analysis shows the influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on Southern Ocean heat uptake—projections with larger (smaller) ENSO amplitude show less (more) ocean warming.},

Methodologies developed to analyze CloudSat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations are employed to investigate the cloud-to-precipitation process of warm clouds and are applied to the model results to examine how the models represent the process for warm stratiform clouds. Despite a limitation of the present study that compares the statistics for stratiform clouds in climate models with those from satellite observations, including both stratiform and (shallow) convective clouds, the statistics constructed with the methodologies are compared between the models and satellite observations to expose their similarities and differences. A problem common to some models is that they tend to produce rain at a faster rate than is observed. These model characteristics are further examined in the context of cloud microphysics parameterizations using a simplified one-dimensional model of warm rain formation that isolates key microphysical processes from full interactions with other processes in global climate models. The one-dimensional model equivalent statistics reproduce key characteristics of the global model statistics when corresponding autoconversion schemes are assumed in the one-dimensional model. The global model characteristics depicted by the statistics are then interpreted as reflecting behaviors of the autoconversion parameterizations adopted in the models. Comparisons of the one-dimensional model with satellite observations hint at improvements to the formulation of the parameterization scheme, thus offering a novel way of constraining key parameters in autoconversion schemes of global models.},

	abstract = {The most recent generation of climate models (the 6th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) yields estimates of effective climate sensitivity (ECS) that are much higher than past generations due to a stronger amplification from cloud feedback. If plausible, these models require substantially larger greenhouse gas reductions to meet global warming targets. We show that models with a more positive cloud feedback also have a stronger cooling effect from aerosol‐cloud interactions. These two effects offset each other during the historical period when both aerosols and greenhouse gases increase, allowing either more positive or neutral cloud feedback models to reproduce the observed global‐mean temperature change. Since anthropogenic aerosols primarily concentrate in the Northern Hemisphere, strong aerosol‐cloud interaction models produce an interhemispheric asymmetric warming. We show that the observed warming asymmetry during the mid to late 20th century is more consistent with low ECS (weak aerosol indirect effect) models. The response of clouds to surface temperature change can amplify or dampen the greenhouse gas induced warming, also known as cloud feedback. We find that in the latest generation of climate models, those models with a more positive cloud feedback tend to have a stronger cooling effect from aerosol‐cloud interaction. The compensation between cloud feedback and aerosol‐cloud interaction enables models to reproduce the historical global‐mean temperature change. In spite of having significantly different surface temperature sensitivity to increasing CO2, the historical record of global‐mean temperature is not a strong constraint in distinguishing these models. However, the interhemispheric difference in temperature over the 20th century provides a constraint that distinguishes the models that have a large or small sensitivity to increasing CO2. Over the 20th century, changes in anthropogenic aerosols were mostly concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, models with strong or weak aerosol‐cloud interactions produce different warming asymmetry over the historical period, and the observed warming asymmetry is more consistent with the models that have weak aerosol‐cloud interactions (and less positive cloud feedback). This study can help us better understand and reduce the uncertainty in the projected future warming. Models with more positive cloud feedback tend to have more negative aerosol‐cloud interaction This compensation relationship enables the models to match the historical warming even with a large spread in climate sensitivity Historical interhemispheric warming indicates the high climate sensitivity models overestimate the aerosol‐cloud interaction Models with more positive cloud feedback tend to have more negative aerosol‐cloud interaction This compensation relationship enables the models to match the historical warming even with a large spread in climate sensitivity Historical interhemispheric warming indicates the high climate sensitivity models overestimate the aerosol‐cloud interaction},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic sulfate (SO4=) aerosol particles play two potential roles in the radiative climate of the earth. In cloud-free air, SO4= particles scatter sunlight, some of which is lost to space, thereby reducing solar irradiance at the ground. The same particles can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), the number concentration of which is an important determinant of cloud albedo. This albedo effect, in turn, also influences incoming short-wave solar radiation. Development of a three-dimensional global model for estimating the SO4= aerosol mass concentration, along with previously-acquired information on the scattering and back-scattering coefficients per unit mass concentration allow calculation of the effects of anthropogenic SO4= aerosol on clear-sky optical depth. Subsequently, this can be used to estimate the change in hemispheric and global average reflected solar radiation. The conclusion is that the change of reflected solar flux due to anthropogenic SO4= averaged over the Northern Hemisphere is ca. − 1.1 Wm−2, which is comparable but opposite in sign to the present-day radiative forcing by anthropogenic CO2, + 1.5 Wm−2. Because of the spatial variability of the anthropogenic SO4= distribution, its meteorological effects must be studied regionally. That is, global models with regional resolution and regional data are required. Unlike the direct effect on solar irradiance, the relationship of CCN number concentration to mass concentration is not known. Thus it is not yet possible to make quantitatively reliable statements about anthropogenic forcing of cloud albedo, although there is qualitative evidence that the CCN effect may also be substantial.},

Climate models and large eddy simulations commonly underestimate the cloud cover, while estimates from observations largely disagree on the cloud cover in the trades. Currently, trade wind clouds significantly contribute to the uncertainty in climate sensitivity estimates derived from model perturbation studies. To simulate clouds well, especially how they change in a future climate, we have to know how cloudy it is. In this study we develop a method to quantify the cloud cover from a cloud-free perspective. Using well-known radiative transfer relations we retrieve the cloud-free contribution in high-resolution satellite observations of trade cumulus cloud fields during EUREC4A. Knowing the cloud-free part, we can investigate the remaining cloud-related contributions consisting of areas detected by common cloud-masking algorithms and undetected areas related to optically thin clouds. We find that the cloud-mask cloud cover underestimates the total cloud cover by 33 \%. Aircraft lidar measurements support our findings by showing a high abundance of optically thin clouds during EUREC4A. Mixing the undetected optically thin clouds into the cloud-free signal can cause an underestimation of the cloud radiative effect of up to -7.5 \%. We further discuss possible artificial correlations in aerosol–cloud cover interaction studies that might arise from undetected optically thin low clouds. Our analysis suggests that the known underestimation of trade wind cloud cover and simultaneous overestimation of cloud brightness in models are even higher than assumed so far.},

We then summarize airborne measurements, made in the troposphere of the Alaskan Arctic, of aerosol particle size distributions, composition, and optical properties and discuss the sources and transport of the aerosols. The aerosol data were grouped into four categories based on gas-phase composition. First, the background troposphere contained a relatively diffuse, sulfate-rich aerosol extending from the top of the sea-ice inversion layer to 7.4 km altitude. Second, a region of depleted (relative to the background) aerosol was present within the surface inversion layer over sea-ice. Third, layers of dense, organic-rich smoke from open biomass fires in southern Russia and southeastern Siberia were frequently encountered at all altitudes from the top of the inversion layer to 7.1 km. Finally, some aerosol layers were dominated by components originating from fossil fuel combustion. Of these four categories measured during ARCPAC, the diffuse background aerosol was most similar to the average springtime aerosol properties observed at a long-term monitoring site at Barrow, Alaska. The biomass burning (BB) and fossil fuel layers were present above the sea-ice inversion layer and did not reach the sea-ice surface during the course of the ARCPAC measurements. The BB aerosol layers were highly scattering and were moderately hygroscopic. On average, the layers produced a noontime net heating of {\textasciitilde}0.1 K day−1 between 3 and 7 km and a slight cooling at the surface. The ratios of particle mass to carbon monoxide (CO) in the BB plumes, which had been transported over distances {\textgreater}5000 km, were comparable to the high end of literature values derived from previous measurements in wildfire smoke. These ratios suggest minimal precipitation scavenging and removal of the BB particles between the time they were emitted and the time they were observed in dense layers above the sea-ice inversion layer.},

Due to PE’s inherent microphysical dependencies, definitions and estimates vary immensely. Consequently, PE’s sensitivity to greenhouse warming and implications for climate change are poorly understood. Here, we quantify PE’s role in climate change by defining a simple index ϵ as the ratio of surface precipitation to condensed water path. This macroscopic metric is reconcilable with microphysical PE measures and higher ϵ is associated with stronger mean Walker circulation. We further find that state-of-the-art climate models disagree on the sign and magnitude of future ϵ changes. This sign disagreement originates from models’ convective parameterizations. Critically, models with increasing ϵ under greenhouse warming, in line with cloud-resolving simulations, show greater slowdown of the large-scale Hadley and Walker circulations and a two-fold greater increase in extreme rainfall than models with decreasing ϵ. Falling raindrops play an essential but as-yet unquantified role in planetary climate change.

Yet, the climatic impact of this evolving spatial pattern of absorbing aerosol has received relatively little attention, in particular its impact on global-mean effective radiative forcing. Here, using model experiments, we show that the effective radiative forcing from absorbing aerosol varies strongly depending on their location, driven by rapid adjustments of clouds and circulation. Our experiments generate positive effective radiative forcing in response to aerosol absorption throughout the midlatitudes and most of the tropical regions, and a strong ‘hot spot’ of negative effective radiative forcing in response to aerosol absorption over the tropical Western Pacific. Further, these diverse responses can be robustly attributed to changes in atmospheric dynamics and highlight the importance of this ‘aerosol pattern effect’ for transient forcing from regional biomass-burning aerosol. Changes in the spatial pattern of aerosol could influence climate through effects on radiative forcing. Model experiments show that while aerosol absorption in the midlatitudes and regions of tropical descent can warm the planet, aerosol absorption in regions of tropical ascent can cool the planet.},

	abstract = {The effects of an initially overlying layer of solar-absorbing aerosol on the transition of stratocumulus to trade cumulus clouds are examined using large-eddy simulations. For lightly drizzling cloud the transition is generally hastened, resulting mainly from increased cloud droplet number concentration (Nc) induced by entrained aerosol. The increased Nc slows sedimentation of cloud droplets and shortens their relaxation time for diffusional growth, both of which accelerate entrainment of overlying air and thereby stratocumulus breakup. However, the decrease in albedo from cloud breakup is more than offset by redistributing cloud water over a greater number of droplets, such that the diurnal-average shortwave forcing at the top of the atmosphere is negative. The negative radiative forcing is enhanced by sizable longwave contributions, which result from the greater cloud breakup and a reduced boundary layer height associated with aerosol heating. A perturbation of moisture instead of aerosol aloft leads to a greater liquid water path and a more gradual transition. Adding absorbing aerosol to that atmosphere results in substantial reductions in liquid water path (LWP) and cloud cover that lead to positive shortwave and negative longwave forcings on average canceling each other. Only for heavily drizzling clouds is the breakup delayed, as inhibition of precipitation overcomes cloud water loss from enhanced entrainment. Considering these simulations as an imperfect proxy for biomass burning plumes influencing Namibian stratocumulus, we expect regional indirect plus semi-direct forcings to be substantially negative to negligible at the top of the atmosphere, with its magnitude sensitive to background and perturbation properties.},

	abstract = {Developing understanding of models and proficiency with modeling practice is challenging for both teachers and students. This 2‐year study first investigated existing instructional strategies employed by teachers while teaching Earth and Space Science with dynamic physical models. Summer professional development introduced a conceptual framework, based on analogical reasoning, to help students strengthen and deepen the connections they make between a model and its real‐world referent. The framework draws explicit attention to correspondences and non‐correspondences between model and referent, an often overlooked component of modeling practice which underpins the ability to evaluate and thus improve a model. Teachers were guided to reflect on their own instructional use of models and to plan for integrating specific instructional strategies around models into their Year 2 practice. Classroom observation data reveal that from Years 1 to 2, teachers shifted from a more didactic approach in which they used physical models primarily as tools for demonstration toward more student engagement with models as problem‐solving tools. On an assessment measuring their students' ability to reason with and about models, pre‐post learning gains were higher in Year 2 than Year 1 across students at all ability levels. Together, these findings present evidence that teachers can learn to guide their students toward using physical models in ways that approximate key aspects of how scientists use runnable models, as envisioned by the Developing and Using Models practice of the Next Generation Science Standards.},

	abstract = {This study has developed a rigorous and efficient maximum likelihood method for estimating the parameters in stochastic energy balance models (with any k {\textgreater} 0 number of boxes) given time series of surface temperature and top-of-the-atmosphere net downward radiative flux. The method works by finding a state-space representation of the linear dynamic system and evaluating the likelihood recursively via the Kalman filter. Confidence intervals for estimated parameters are straightforward to construct in the maximum likelihood framework, and information criteria may be used to choose an optimal number of boxes for parsimonious k-box emulation of atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). In addition to estimating model parameters the method enables hidden state estimation for the unobservable boxes corresponding to the deep ocean, and also enables noise filtering for observations of surface temperature. Feasibility, reliability and performance of the proposed method are demonstrated in a simulation study. In order to obtain a set of optimal k-box emulators, models are fitted to the 4×CO2 step responses of 16 AOGCMs in CMIP5. It is found that for all 16 AOGCMs three boxes are required for optimal k-box emulation. The number of boxes, k, is found to influence, sometimes strongly, the impulse responses of the fitted models.},

Most solutions rely on changes to the chemical composition of the atmosphere to compensate via a stronger greenhouse effect, whereas physical feedbacks have received less attention. We perform global climate model experiments, using two versions of the Community Atmosphere Model, in which a reduced solar constant is offset by higher CO2. Model runs corresponding to past climate show a substantial decrease in low clouds and hence planetary albedo compared with present, which contributes 40\% of the required forcing to offset the faint Sun. Through time, the climatically important stratocumulus decks have grown in response to a brightening Sun and decreasing greenhouse effect, driven by stronger cloud-top radiative cooling (which drives low cloud formation) and a stronger inversion (which sustains clouds against dry air entrainment from above). We find that systematic changes to low clouds have had a major role in stabilizing climate through Earth’s history, which demonstrates the importance of physical feedbacks on long-term climate stabilization, and a smaller role for geochemical feedbacks. Reduced planetary albedo due to fewer low clouds on early Earth could explain some 40\% of the required forcing to offset the faint young Sun, according to global climate model experiments.},

We study black carbon (BC), sulphate (SO4) and a black and organic carbon mixture typical of biomass burning (BIO), by prescribing aerosol burdens in layers between 1000 hPa and 20 hPa and calculating the resulting direct radiative forcing divided by the burden (NDRF). We find a strong sensitivity in the NDRF for BC with altitude, with a tenfold increase between BC close to the surface and the lower part of the stratosphere. Clouds are a major contributor to this dependence with altitude, but other factors also contribute. We break down and explain the different physical contributors to this strong sensitivity. The results show a modest regional dependence of the altitudinal dependence of BC NDRF between industrial regions, while for regions with properties deviating from the global mean NDRF variability is significant. Variations due to seasons and interannual changes in cloud conditions are found to be small. We explore the effect that large altitudinal variation in NDRF may have on model estimates of BC radiative forcing when vertical aerosol distributions are insufficiently constrained, and discuss possible applications of the present results for reducing inter-model differences.},

Here we examine the same system using a method introduced by , which generalizes standard nudging methods to utilize time delayed measurements. We show that in certain circumstances, it provides a sizable reduction in the number of observations required to construct accurate estimates and high-quality predictions.

However, their development has been stymied by uncertainty surrounding whether or not improved offline performance translates to improved online performance (i.e., when coupled to a large-scale general circulation model (GCM)). A key barrier has been the limited sampling of the online effects of the ML design decisions and tuning due to the complexity of performing large ensembles of hybrid physics-ML climate simulations. Our work examines the coupled behavior of full-physics ML parameterizations using large ensembles of hybrid simulations, totalling 2,970 in our case. With extensive sampling, we statistically confirm that lowering offline error lowers online error (given certain constraints). However, we also reveal that decisions decreasing online error, like removing dropout, can trade off against hybrid model stability and vice versa. Nevertheless, we are able to identify design decisions that yield unambiguous improvements to offline and online performance, namely incorporating memory and training on multiple climates. We also find that converting moisture input from specific to relative humidity enhances online stability and that using a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss breaks the aforementioned offline/online error relationship. By enabling rapid online experimentation at scale, we empirically answer previously unresolved questions regarding subgrid ML parameterization design.},

In this first part, the extent to which climate biases develop at weather forecast timescales is assessed with two PPEs, which are based on 5-day forecasts and 10-year simulations with a relatively coarse resolution (N96) atmosphere-only model. Both ensembles share common parameter combinations and strong emergent relationships are found for a wide range of variables between the errors on two timescales. These relationships between the PPEs are demonstrated at several spatial scales from global (using mean square errors), to regional (using pattern correlations), and to individual grid boxes where a large fraction of them show positive correlations. The study confirms more robustly than in previous studies that investigating the errors on weather timescales provides an affordable way to identify and filter out model variants that perform poorly at short timescales and are likely to perform poorly at longer timescales too. The use of PPEs also provides additional information for model development, by identifying parameters and processes responsible for model errors at the two different timescales, and systematic errors that cannot be removed by any combination of parameter values.},

We show that any probabilistic estimate of climate sensitivity, and hence of the risk that a given greenhouse gas stabilisation level might result in a “dangerous” equilibrium warming, is critically dependent on subjective prior assumptions of the investigators, not simply on constraints provided by actual climate observations. This apparent arbitrariness can be resolved by focussing on the intended purpose of the forecast: while uncertainty in long-term equilibrium warming remains high, an objectively determined 10–90\% (5–95\%) range of uncertainty in climate sensitivity that is relevant to forecasts of 21st century transient warming under nearly all current emission scenarios is 1.4–4.1°C with a median of 2.4°C, in good agreement with the “traditional” range.},

However, assessment of the impacts of climate change tends to focus on the ultimate level of global warming1, only occasionally on the rate of global warming, and rarely on variability about the trend. Here we show that models that are more sensitive to GHGs emissions (that is, higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)) also have higher temperature variability on timescales of several years to several decades2. Counter-intuitively, high-sensitivity climates, as well as having a higher chance of rapid decadal warming, are also more likely to have had historical ‘hiatus’ periods than lower-sensitivity climates. Cooling or hiatus decades over the historical period, which have been relatively uncommon, are more than twice as likely in a high-ECS world (ECS = 4.5 K) compared with a low-ECS world (ECS = 1.5 K). As ECS also affects the background warming rate under future scenarios with unmitigated anthropogenic forcing, the probability of a hyper-warming decade—over ten times the mean rate of global warming for the twentieth century—is even more sensitive to ECS. Projections of temperature often focus on maximum warming levels, with variability less often considered. Investigating decadal variability in models shows those with higher equilibrium climate sensitivity also have a higher chance of super warming, and hiatus periods.},

Here we show that, for simple geometrical reasons, the combination of both the level and rate of human-induced warming provides a remarkably accurate prediction of remaining emission budgets to peak warming across a broad range of scenarios, if budgets are expressed in terms of CO2-forcing-equivalent emissions. These in turn predict CO2 emissions budgets if (but only if) the fractional contribution of non-CO2 drivers to warming remains approximately unchanged, as it does in some ambitious mitigation scenarios, indicating a best-estimate remaining budget for 1.5 °C of about 22 years’ current emissions from mid-2017, with a ‘likely’ (1 standard error) range of 13–32 years. This provides a simple, transparent and model-independent metric of progress towards an ambitious temperature stabilization goal that could be used to inform the Paris Agreement stocktake process. It is less applicable to less ambitious goals. Alternative definitions of current warming and scenarios for non-CO2 drivers give lower 1.5 °C budgets. Lower budgets based on the MAGICC simple modelling system widely used in integrated assessment studies reflect its relatively high simulated current warming rates. A combination of the level and rate of human-induced warming allows estimation of remaining emission budgets to peak warming across a broad range of scenarios, suggests an analysis of emissions budgets expressed in terms of CO2-forcing-equivalent emissions.},

	abstract = {We present the implementation and evaluation of a sectional aerosol microphysics module SALSA within the aerosol-climate model ECHAM5-HAM. This aerosol microphysics module has been designed to be flexible and computationally efficient so that it can be implemented in regional or global scale models. The computational efficiency has been achieved by minimising the number of variables needed to describe the size and composition distribution. The aerosol size distribution is described using 10 size classes with parallel sections which can have different chemical compositions. Thus in total, the module tracks 20 size sections which cover diameters ranging from 3 nm to 10 μm and are divided into three subranges, each with an optimised selection of processes and compounds. The implementation of SALSA into ECHAM5-HAM includes the main aerosol processes in the atmosphere: emissions, removal, radiative effects, liquid and gas phase sulphate chemistry, and the aerosol microphysics. The aerosol compounds treated in the module are sulphate, organic carbon, sea salt, black carbon, and mineral dust. In its default configuration, ECHAM5-HAM treats aerosol size distribution using the modal method. In this implementation, the aerosol processes were converted to be used in a sectional model framework. The ability of the module to describe the global aerosol properties was evaluated by comparing against (1) measured continental and marine size distributions, (2) observed variability of continental number concentrations, (3) measured sulphate, organic carbon, black carbon and sea-salt mass concentrations, (4) observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and other aerosol optical properties from satellites and AERONET network, (5) global aerosol budgets and concentrations from previous model studies, and (6) model results using M7, which is the default aerosol microphysics module in ECHAM5-HAM. The evaluation shows that the global aerosol properties can be reproduced reasonably well using a coarse resolution of 10 sections in size space. The simulated global aerosol budgets are within the range of previous studies. Surface concentrations of sulphate and carbonaceous species have an annual mean within a factor of two of the observations. The simulated sea-salt concentrations reproduce the observations within a factor of two, apart from the Southern Ocean over which the concentrations are within a factor of five. Regionally, AOD is in a relatively good agreement with the observations (within a factor of two). At mid-latitudes the observed AOD is captured well, while at high-latitudes as well as in some polluted and dust regions the modelled AOD is significantly lower than observed. Regarding most of the investigated aerosol properties, the SALSA and the modal aerosol module M7 perform comparably well against observations. However, SALSA reproduces the observed number concentrations and the size distribution of CCN sized particles much more accurately than M7, and is therefore a good choice for aerosol-cloud interaction studies in global models. Our study also shows that when activation type nucleation in the boundary layer is included, the observed concentration of particles under 50 nm in diameter are reproduced much better compared to when only binary nucleation in the free troposphere is assumed.},

	abstract = {We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult‐to‐quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6–3.9 K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3–4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5–95\% ranges are 2.3–4.7 K, bounded by 2.0–5.7 K (although such high‐confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing‐feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes. Earth's global “climate sensitivity” is a fundamental quantitative measure of the susceptibility of Earth's climate to human influence. A landmark report in 1979 concluded that it probably lies between 1.5°C and 4.5°C per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, assuming that other influences on climate remain unchanged. In the 40 years since, it has appeared difficult to reduce this uncertainty range. In this report we thoroughly assess all lines of evidence including some new developments. We find that a large volume of consistent evidence now points to a more confident view of a climate sensitivity near the middle or upper part of this range. In particular, it now appears extremely unlikely that the climate sensitivity could be low enough to avoid substantial climate change (well in excess of 2°C warming) under a high‐emission future scenario. We remain unable to rule out that the sensitivity could be above 4.5°C per doubling of carbon dioxide levels, although this is not likely. Continued research is needed to further reduce the uncertainty, and we identify some of the more promising possibilities in this regard. We assess evidence relevant to Earth's climate sensitivity S: feedback process understanding and the historical and paleoclimate records All three lines of evidence are difficult to reconcile with S {\textless} 2 K, while paleo evidence provides the strongest case against S {\textgreater} 4.5 K A Bayesian calculation finds a 66\% range of 2.6–3.9 K, which remains within the bounds 2.3–4.5 K under plausible robustness tests},

	abstract = {While internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments [e.g., phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)]. As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). The core simulations replay the twenty to twenty-first century (1920–2100) 30 times under historical and representative concentration pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-yr-long preindustrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on twentieth- to twenty-first-century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change.},

	abstract = {Producing targeted climate information at the local scale, including major sources of climate change projection uncertainty for diverse emissions scenarios, is essential to support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Here, we present the first chain of computationally efficient Earth System Model (ESM) emulators allowing to rapidly translate greenhouse gas emission pathways into spatially resolved annual-mean temperature anomaly field time series, accounting for both forced climate response and natural variability uncertainty at the local scale. By combining the global-mean, emissions-driven emulator MAGICC with the spatially resolved emulator MESMER, ESM-specific as well as constrained probabilistic emulated ensembles can be derived. This emulation chain can hence build on and extend large multi-ESM ensembles such as the ones produced within the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The main extensions are threefold. (i) A more thorough sampling of the forced climate response and the natural variability uncertainty is possible with millions of emulated realizations being readily created. (ii) The same uncertainty space can be sampled for any emission pathway, which is not the case in CMIP6, where some of the most societally relevant strong mitigation scenarios have been run by only a small number of ESMs. (iii) Other lines of evidence to constrain future projections, including observational constraints, can be introduced, which helps to refine projected future ranges beyond the multi-ESM ensemble's estimates. In addition to presenting results from the coupled MAGICC-MESMER emulator chain, we carry out an extensive validation of MESMER, which is trained on and applied to multiple emission pathways for the first time in this study. The newly developed MAGICC-MESMER coupled emulator will allow unprecedented assessments of the implications of manifold emissions pathways at regional scale.},

It plays a significant role in the formation, evolution, and maintenance of the Sc cloud system. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating the CTRC, with high accuracy, from passive satellite data only. The estimation relies on a radiative transfer model with inputs from satellite‐retrieved cloud parameters in combination with reanalysis sounding that is revised, in a physically coherent way, by satellite data. The satellite‐based estimates CTRC agree with ground‐based ones to within {\textasciitilde} 10\%. The high accuracy largely benefits from the good capability of satellite data in constraining parameters of most influence to the CTRC such as free‐tropospheric sounding, cloud‐top temperature, and cloud optical depth. Applying this technique, we generate a climatology of CTRC during summer over the Southern Hemisphere tropical and subtropical oceans. Cloud top radiative cooling rate (CTRC) is a fundamental physical variable for understanding many essential behaviors of marine low clouds More accurate retrieval of CTRC is feasible from satellite with a retrieval uncertainty of 10\% demonstrated by comparing them with “ground truth” A single summertime climatology of CTRC over the Southern Hemisphere oceans is generated, showing physically coherent results},

However, the magnitude and sign of the net radiative effect is strongly dependent on the physical properties of the black carbon (BC) component of the particles, such as mass concentration, number size distribution and mixing state. Here we use a global aerosol model combined with aircraft measurements of BC particle number and size from the Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) to assess the realism with which these physical properties are predicted by global models. The comparison reveals a substantial mismatch between the measured and modelled BC size distribution over the size range of the SP2 instrument (90–400 nm BC diameter). The model predicts BC particle number concentrations a factor {\textasciitilde}3.5–5.7 higher than measured and a mode diameter that is {\textasciitilde}40–65 nm smaller than observed. More than {\textasciitilde}90\% of the model particles with dry diameters \&gtrsim;260 nm contain BC, while the observations suggest only 14\% on average. These model–observation biases in the BC properties are considerably greater than for the overall particle distribution, suggesting that the discrepancy is associated with model assumptions about the size and mixing state of the emitted carbonaceous particles. We expect the discrepancy in BC size distribution to be common among most global aerosol models, with implications for model estimates of absorption optical depth and direct radiative forcing.},

This study synthesises selected aircraft, ship and surface site observations from VOCALS-REx to statistically summarise and characterise the atmospheric composition and variability of the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) and Free Troposphere (FT) along the 20° S parallel between 70° W and 85° W. Significant zonal gradients in mean MBL sub-micron aerosol particle size and composition, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone were seen over the campaign, with a generally more variable and polluted coastal environment and a less variable, more pristine remote maritime regime. Gradients in aerosol and trace gas concentrations were observed to be associated with strong gradients in cloud droplet number. The FT was often more polluted in terms of trace gases than the MBL in the mean; however increased variability in the FT composition suggests an episodic nature to elevated concentrations. This is consistent with a complex vertical interleaving of airmasses with diverse sources and hence pollutant concentrations as seen by generalised back trajectory analysis, which suggests contributions from both local and long-range sources. Furthermore, back trajectory analysis demonstrates that the observed zonal gradients both in the boundary layer and the free troposphere are characteristic of marked changes in airmass history with distance offshore – coastal boundary layer airmasses having been in recent contact with the local land surface and remote maritime airmasses having resided over ocean for in excess of ten days. Boundary layer composition to the east of 75° W was observed to be dominated by coastal emissions from sources to the west of the Andes, with evidence for diurnal pumping of the Andean boundary layer above the height of the marine capping inversion. Analysis of intra-campaign variability in atmospheric composition was not found to be significantly correlated with observed low-frequency variability in the large scale flow pattern; campaign-average interquartile ranges of CO, SO2 and O3 concentrations at all longitudes were observed to dominate over much smaller differences in median concentrations calculated between periods of different flow regimes. The campaign climatology presented here aims to provide a valuable dataset to inform model simulation and future process studies, particularly in the context of aerosol-cloud interaction and further evaluation of dynamical processes in the SEP region for conditions analogous to those during VOCALS-REx. To this end, our results are discussed in terms of coastal, transitional and remote spatial regimes in the MBL and FT and a gridded dataset are provided as a resource.},

Our approach is to model the deterministic output as the realization of a stochastic process, thereby providing a statistical basis for designing experiments (choosing the inputs) for efficient prediction.

We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation.

	abstract = {Data‐driven approaches, most prominently deep learning, have become powerful tools for prediction in many domains. A natural question to ask is whether data‐driven methods could also be used to predict global weather patterns days in advance. First studies show promise but the lack of a common data set and evaluation metrics make intercomparison between studies difficult. Here we present a benchmark data set for data‐driven medium‐range weather forecasting (specifically 3–5 days), a topic of high scientific interest for atmospheric and computer scientists alike. We provide data derived from the ERA5 archive that has been processed to facilitate the use in machine learning models. We propose simple and clear evaluation metrics which will enable a direct comparison between different methods. Further, we provide baseline scores from simple linear regression techniques, deep learning models, as well as purely physical forecasting models. The data set is publicly available at https://github.com/pangeo‐data/WeatherBench and the companion code is reproducible with tutorials for getting started. We hope that this data set will accelerate research in data‐driven weather forecasting. WeatherBench provides a new benchmark to test data‐driven approaches to weather forecasting. Traditional weather models are based on the discretized equations governing the atmosphere. They perform very well for many tasks but are still found lacking for some others. Data‐driven approaches, such as deep learning, directly learn from the best available observations and could potentially produce better forecasts. In this paper, we define a benchmark task—predicting pressure and temperature across the globe 3 and 5 days ahead—which will hopefully lead to progress in data‐driven weather prediction and foster collaboration across disciplines. Benchmarks with strong baselines are a key ingredient for rapid progress on a problem Here, we define a benchmark for data‐driven global, medium‐range weather prediction The data are processed for convenient use in machine learning models, and a quickstart guide is provided},

By substituting the MAD representation of aerosol size distributions into the governing equation for aerosol processes, the governing differential equations for MAD models are derived.

	abstract = {We apply an established statistical methodology called history matching to constrain the parameter space of a coupled non-flux-adjusted climate model (the third Hadley Centre Climate Model; HadCM3) by using a 10,000-member perturbed physics ensemble and observational metrics. History matching uses emulators (fast statistical representations of climate models that include a measure of uncertainty in the prediction of climate model output) to rule out regions of the parameter space of the climate model that are inconsistent with physical observations given the relevant uncertainties. Our methods rule out about half of the parameter space of the climate model even though we only use a small number of historical observations. We explore 2 dimensional projections of the remaining space and observe a region whose shape mainly depends on parameters controlling cloud processes and one ocean mixing parameter. We find that global mean surface air temperature (SAT) is the dominant constraint of those used, and that the others provide little further constraint after matching to SAT. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has a non linear relationship with SAT and is not a good proxy for the meridional heat transport in the unconstrained parameter space, but these relationships are linear in our reduced space. We find that the transient response of the AMOC to idealised CO2 forcing at 1 and 2 \% per year shows a greater average reduction in strength in the constrained parameter space than in the unconstrained space. We test extended ranges of a number of parameters of HadCM3 and discover that no part of the extended ranges can by ruled out using any of our constraints. Constraining parameter space using easy to emulate observational metrics prior to analysis of more complex processes is an important and powerful tool. It can remove complex and irrelevant behaviour in unrealistic parts of parameter space, allowing the processes in question to be more easily studied or emulated, perhaps as a precursor to the application of further relevant constraints.},

	abstract = {Committed warming describes how much future warming can be expected from historical emissions due to inertia in the climate system. It is usually defined in terms of the level of warming above the present for an abrupt halt of emissions. Owing to socioeconomic constraints, this situation is unlikely, so we focus on the committed warming from present-day fossil fuel assets. Here we show that if carbon-intensive infrastructure is phased out at the end of its design lifetime from the end of 2018, there is a 64\% chance that peak global mean temperature rise remains below 1.5 °C. Delaying mitigation until 2030 considerably reduces the likelihood that 1.5 °C would be attainable even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated. Although the challenges laid out by the Paris Agreement are daunting, we indicate 1.5 °C remains possible and is attainable with ambitious and immediate emission reduction across all sectors. Power plants, vehicles and industry will continue to produce emissions for as long as they are used. Here, the authors show that retiring existing fossil fuel infrastructure at the end of its expected lifetime provides a good chance that the 1.5 °C Paris Agreement target can still be met.},

Although several robust precipitation responses have been identified under continued increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs), considerable uncertainty remains. This is particularly the case at regional scales, including the West Coast of the United States and California. Here, we exploit idealized, single forcing simulations from the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) to address how climate drivers impact California wintertime precipitation. Consistent with recent work, GHGs including carbon dioxide and methane, as well as solar forcing, yield a robust increase in California wintertime precipitation. We also find robust California precipitation responses to aerosols but with opposite responses for sulfate versus black carbon aerosol. Sulfate aerosol increases California wintertime precipitation, whereas black carbon reduces it. Moreover, California precipitation is more sensitive to aerosols, particularly regional emissions from Europe and Asia, than to GHGs. These precipitation responses are consistent with shifts in the jet stream and altered moisture fluxes. Although the idealized nature of PDRMIP simulations precludes a formal attribution, our results suggest that aerosols can perturb precipitation and fresh water resources along the West Coast of the United States. In addition to GHGs, CA wintertime precipitation increases under sulfate forcing, particularly European and Asian sulfate In contrast, black carbon aerosols decrease California precipitation California precipitation is more sensitive to aerosols than to GHGs and solar forcing},

	abstract = {The microphysical properties of convective clouds determine their radiative effects on climate, the amount and intensity of precipitation as well as dynamical features. Realistic simulation of these cloud properties presents a major challenge. In particular, because models are complex and slow to run, we have little understanding of how the considerable uncertainties in parameterized processes feed through to uncertainty in the cloud responses. Here we use statistical emulation to enable a Monte Carlo sampling of a convective cloud model to quantify the sensitivity of 12 cloud properties to aerosol concentrations and nine model parameters representing the main microphysical processes. We examine the response of liquid and ice-phase hydrometeor concentrations, precipitation, and cloud dynamics for a deep convective cloud in a continental environment. Across all cloud responses, the concentration of the Aitken and accumulation aerosol modes and the collection efficiency of droplets by graupel particles have the most influence on the uncertainty. However, except at very high aerosol concentrations, uncertainties in precipitation intensity and amount are affected more by interactions between drops and graupel than by large variations in aerosol. The uncertainties in ice crystal mass and number are controlled primarily by the shape of the crystals, ice nucleation rates, and aerosol concentrations. Overall, although aerosol particle concentrations are an important factor in deep convective clouds, uncertainties in several processes significantly affect the reliability of complex microphysical models. The results suggest that our understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction could be greatly advanced by extending the emulator approach to models of cloud systems.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive two‐moment microphysics scheme is incorporated into the MIROC6‐SPRINTARS aerosol‐climate model. The new scheme includes prognostic precipitation for both rain and snow, and considers their radiative effects. To evaluate the impacts of applying different treatments of precipitation and the associated radiative effect, we perform climate simulations employing both the traditional diagnostic and new prognostic precipitation schemes, the latter also being tested with and without incorporating the radiative effect of snow. The prognostic precipitation, which maintains precipitation in the atmosphere across multiple time steps, models the ratio of accretion to autoconversion as being approximately an order of magnitude higher than that for the diagnostic scheme. Such changes in microphysical process rates tend to reduce the cloud water susceptibility as the autoconversion process is the only pathway through which aerosols can influence rain formation. The resultant anthropogenic aerosol effect is reduced by approximately 21\% in the prognostic precipitation scheme. Modifications to the microphysical process rates also change the vertical distribution of hydrometeors in the manner that increases the fractional occurrence of single‐layered warm clouds by 38\%. The new scheme mitigates the excess of supercooled liquid water produced by the previous scheme and increases the total mass of ice hydrometeors. Both characteristics are consistent with CloudSat/CALIPSO retrievals. The radiative effect of snow is significant at both long‐ and shortwave (6.4 W m−2 and 5.1 W m−2 in absolute values, respectively), and can alter the precipitation fields via energetic controls on precipitation. These results suggest that the prognostic precipitation scheme, with its radiative effects incorporated, makes an indispensable contribution to improving the reliability of climate modeling. Prognostic precipitation (both rain and snow) and its radiative effects are introduced into the MIROC6‐SPRINTARS aerosol‐climate model. Aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation‐climate interactions are evaluated using multi‐sensor satellite datasets for different treatments of rain. The radiative effect of snow is significant for both long‐ and shortwave radiation, and must be included for more reliable climate modeling.},

Both the direct scattering of shortwavelength solar radiation and the modification of the shortwave reflective properties of clouds by sulfate aerosol particles increase planetary albedo, thereby exerting a cooling influence on the planet. Current climate forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate is estimated to be -1 to -2 watts per square meter, globally averaged. This perturbation is comparable in magnitude to current anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing but opposite in sign. Thus, the aerosol forcing has likely offset global greenhouse warming to a substantial degree. However, differences in geographical and seasonal distributions of these forcings preclude any simple compensation. Aerosol effects must be taken into account in evaluating anthropogenic influences on past, current, and projected future climate and in formulating policy regarding controls on emission of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide. Resolution of such policy issues requires integrated research on the magnitude and geographical distribution of aerosol climate forcing and on the controlling chemical and physical processes.},

	abstract = {Aerosol‐cloud interaction is the most uncertain mechanism of anthropogenic radiative forcing of Earth's climate, and aerosol‐induced cloud water changes are particularly poorly constrained in climate models. By combining satellite retrievals of volcano and ship tracks in stratocumulus clouds, we compile a unique observational data set and confirm that liquid water path (LWP) responses to aerosols are bidirectional, and on average the increases in LWP are closely compensated by the decreases. Moreover, the meteorological parameters controlling the LWP responses are strikingly similar between the volcano and ship tracks. In stark contrast to observations, there are substantial unidirectional increases in LWP in the Hadley Centre climate model, because the model accounts only for the decreased precipitation efficiency and not for the enhanced entrainment drying. If the LWP increases in the model were compensated by the decreases as the observations suggest, its indirect aerosol radiative forcing in stratocumulus regions would decrease by 45\%. It remains unclear how much of the global warming induced by greenhouse gases is offset by aerosols because the effect of aerosol particles on clouds is the most uncertain mechanism of forcing of Earth's climate by human activities. Cloud water responses to aerosols are especially uncertain. Here we compare the properties of low marine clouds impacted by volcanic and ship emissions with the properties of the nearby unpolluted clouds in order to increase the understanding of aerosol impacts on clouds. Clouds impacted by emissions from volcanoes and ships lose or gain water depending on meteorological conditions, but on average the amount of water does not change much in the polluted clouds. These observations disagree with the systematic increases in cloud water in response to aerosols simulated by the Hadley Centre climate model. This model, like other contemporary climate models, only accounts for cloud water increases that result from decreased precipitation efficiency and does not account for the enhanced drying in polluted clouds. Our results suggest that the ability of aerosols to offset global warming might be overestimated. The observational constraints derived here on aerosol‐induced cloud water changes would ultimately translate into reduced uncertainties in projections of the future climate. Volcano and ship tracks reveal bidirectional changes in cloud water in response to aerosols, dependent on meteorological conditions In contrast to common behavior of climate models, observations suggest that increases in cloud water are closely compensated by decreases Accounting for the aerosol enhanced entrainment would offset cloud water increases and result in weaker indirect effects in climate models},

For each MCS event, four simulations were conducted in which the initial vertical location and concentrations of cloud droplet nucleating APs were varied. These simulations were used to determine the precipitation response to AP vertical location. Importantly, the total integrated number and mass of the initial aerosol profiles used in the sensitivity simulations remained constant, such that differences in the simulations could be directly attributable to changes in the vertical location of cloud droplet nucleating APs. These simulations demonstrate that lower-tropospheric APs largely influenced the precipitation response directly rearward of the leading cold pool boundary. However, farther rearward in the MCS, the relative impact of lower- versus midtropospheric APs largely depended on the MCS structure, which varied between the two events because of differences in line-normal wind shear. Midtropospheric APs were able to activate new cloud droplets in the midtropospheric levels of convective updrafts and to enhance mixed-phase precipitation through increased cloud riming, and this microphysical pathway had a more significant impact on mixed-phase precipitation in weaker line-normal wind shear conditions. This result exposes the importance of properly representing midtropospheric APs when assessing aerosol effects on clouds. This study also demonstrates the utility of assessing aerosol effects within the different regions of MCSs.},

Previous work has found a substantial decrease in the detection of ship tracks in clouds after the IMO 2020 regulations went into effect, but changes in large-scale cloud properties have been more equivocal. Using a statistical technique that estimates counterfactual fields of what large-scale cloud and radiative properties within an isolated shipping corridor in the southeastern Atlantic would have been in the absence of shipping, we confidently detect a reduction in the magnitude of cloud droplet effective radius decreases within the shipping corridor and find evidence for a reduction in the magnitude of cloud brightening as well. The instantaneous radiative forcing due to aerosol–cloud interactions from the IMO 2020 regulations is estimated as O(1 W m-2) within the shipping corridor, lending credence to global estimates of O(0.1 W m-2). In addition to their geophysical significance, our results also provide independent evidence for general compliance with the IMO 2020 regulations.},

These lines, found over the ocean, are composed of liquid particles. Hollow polygonal, convective or thin stratiform, cloud patterns in varying amounts are associated with the lines. Numerous lines within a 10-deg square have been observed which cover up to 4 per cent of the total area. The most likely cause of the cloud lines stems from the exhaust of ocean going vessels. Large numbers of Aitken nuclei form in this exhaust. These are carried upward by the buoyancy of the hot gases and “ships air wake” to form droplets at slight supersaturation. The phenomenon does not appear related to special characteristics of the vessel's power plant but to a critical condition of the atmosphere. As far as is known, this condition may be described as having 1) a convectively unstable layer from the surface to a low-level stable layer, 2) saturation or slight supersaturation near the top of the convective layer, and 3) a convective layer, presumably deficient in cloud forming nuclei. Nuclei are produced in sufficient quantity by an average size ship, moving at 10 m sec−1 relative to the wind, to generate 200 droplets cm−3 throughout a depth of 200 m and width of 1.9 km. The theoretical increase in albedo of the new cloud over that of the old maritime cloud is about 25 per cent, an amount comparable to that indicated in the photographs.},

The neural network clearly outperforms a persistence forecast and does not show substantially degraded performance even when the forecast length is extended to 120 months. The model is prone to underpredicting precipitation in areas characterized by intense precipitation events. Scheduled sampling (forcing the model to gradually use its own past predictions rather than ground truth) is essential for avoiding amplification of early forecasting errors. However, the use of scheduled sampling also necessitates preforecasting (generating forecasts prior to the first forecast date) to obtain adequate performance for the first few prediction time steps.

	abstract = {Here we present an update to the FaIR model for use in probabilistic future climate and scenario exploration, integrated assessment, policy analysis, and education. In this update we have focussed on identifying a minimum level of structural complexity in the model. The result is a set of six equations, five of which correspond to the standard impulse response model used for greenhouse gas (GHG) metric calculations in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, plus one additional physically motivated equation to represent state-dependent feedbacks on the response timescales of each greenhouse gas cycle. This additional equation is necessary to reproduce non-linearities in the carbon cycle apparent in both Earth system models and observations. These six equations are transparent and sufficiently simple that the model is able to be ported into standard tabular data analysis packages, such as Excel, increasing the potential user base considerably. However, we demonstrate that the equations are flexible enough to be tuned to emulate the behaviour of several key processes within more complex models from CMIP6. The model is exceptionally quick to run, making it ideal for integrating large probabilistic ensembles. We apply a constraint based on the current estimates of the global warming trend to a million-member ensemble, using the constrained ensemble to make scenario-dependent projections and infer ranges for properties of the climate system. Through these analyses, we reaffirm that simple climate models (unlike more complex models) are not themselves intrinsically biased “hot” or “cold”: it is the choice of parameters and how those are selected that determines the model response, something that appears to have been misunderstood in the past. This updated FaIR model is able to reproduce the global climate system response to GHG and aerosol emissions with sufficient accuracy to be useful in a wide range of applications and therefore could be used as a lowest-common-denominator model to provide consistency in different contexts. The fact that FaIR can be written down in just six equations greatly aids transparency in such contexts.},

The measurements provide a climatology of CCN properties characteristic of a remote central Amazonian rain forest site.The CCN measurements were continuously cycled through 10 levels of supersaturation (S  =  0.11 to 1.10 \%) and span the aerosol particle size range from 20 to 245 nm. The mean critical diameters of CCN activation range from 43 nm at S  =  1.10 \% to 172 nm at S  =  0.11 \%. The particle hygroscopicity exhibits a pronounced size dependence with lower values for the Aitken mode (κAit  =  0.14 ± 0.03), higher values for the accumulation mode (κAcc  =  0.22 ± 0.05), and an overall mean value of κmean  =  0.17 ± 0.06, consistent with high fractions of organic aerosol.The hygroscopicity parameter, κ, exhibits remarkably little temporal variability: no pronounced diurnal cycles, only weak seasonal trends, and few short-term variations during long-range transport events. In contrast, the CCN number concentrations exhibit a pronounced seasonal cycle, tracking the pollution-related seasonality in total aerosol concentration. We find that the variability in the CCN concentrations in the central Amazon is mostly driven by aerosol particle number concentration and size distribution, while variations in aerosol hygroscopicity and chemical composition matter only during a few episodes.For modeling purposes, we compare different approaches of predicting CCN number concentration and present a novel parametrization, which allows accurate CCN predictions based on a small set of input data.},

	abstract = {A statistical synthesis of marine aerosol measurements from experiments in four different oceans is used to evaluate a global aerosol microphysics model (GLOMAP). We compare the model against observed size resolved particle concentrations, probability distributions, and the temporal persistence of different size particles. We attempt to explain the observed sub-micrometre size distributions in terms of sulfate and sea spray and quantify the possible contributions of anthropogenic sulfate and carbonaceous material to the number and mass distribution. The model predicts a bimodal size distribution that agrees well with observations as a grand average over all regions, but there are large regional differences. Notably, observed Aitken mode number concentrations are more than a factor 10 higher than in the model for the N Atlantic but a factor 7 lower than the model in the NW Pacific. We also find that modelled Aitken mode and accumulation mode geometric mean diameters are generally smaller in the model by 10–30\%. Comparison with observed free tropospheric Aitken mode distributions suggests that the model underpredicts growth of these particles during descent to the marine boundary layer (MBL). Recent observations of a substantial organic component of free tropospheric aerosol could explain this discrepancy. We find that anthropogenic continental material makes a substantial contribution to N Atlantic MBL aerosol, with typically 60–90\% of sulfate across the particle size range coming from anthropogenic sources, even if we analyse air that has spent an average of {\textgreater}120 h away from land. However, anthropogenic primary black carbon and organic carbon particles (at the emission size and quantity assumed here) do not explain the large discrepancies in Aitken mode number. Several explanations for the discrepancy are suggested. The lack of lower atmospheric particle formation in the model may explain low N Atlantic particle concentrations. However, the observed and modelled particle persistence at Cape Grim in the Southern Ocean, does not reveal a diurnal cycle consistent with a photochemically driven local particle source. We also show that a physically based cloud drop activation scheme better explains the observed change in accumulation mode geometric mean diameter with particle number.},

	abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slow changes of climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” isturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.},

This occurred in the presence of pollution and mineral dust aerosol surface areas as high as 1200 μm2 cm−3. Concentrations of sulfuric acid generally appeared insufficient for binary nucleation, but observations, models, and theory are consistent with a ternary nucleation mechanism involving H2SO4-H2O-NH3. Growth rates of ∼2 nm h−1 can be explained by the condensation of sulfuric acid at a rate of 2 ± 1 × 106 molecules cm−3 s−1. Aerosol volatility suggested increasing neutralization of the aerosol during growth. Size distribution measurements suggest that weak (mean condensation nuclei (CN) 3–13 nm ≈ 500 cm−3) new particle production was a common occurrence in the region. However, new particle production was enhanced by ∼1 order of magnitude (mean CN 3–13 nm ≈ 5000 cm−3) in postfrontal air masses associated with offshore flow during cloud-free conditions. Fog and clouds appear to be regionally important in modulating nucleation events through scavenging of secondary aerosol and through depletion of gas-phase precursors through enhanced heterogeneous chemistry. Our results indicate that only 10–30\% of the total aerosol population consists of aged secondary aerosols after ∼2 days of transport from source regions. In spite of their high production during nucleation events, secondary aerosols advected out over the Pacific Ocean will have a small impact upon indirect forcing and a negligible impact upon direct forcing compared to primary aerosol emissions and the species that condense upon them.},

	abstract = {How Earth's climate reacts to anthropogenic forcing is one of the most burning questions faced by today’s scientific community. A leading source of uncertainty in estimating this sensitivity is related to the response of clouds. Under the canonical climate-change perspective of forcings and feedbacks, the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds is categorized under the forcing component, while the modifications of the radiative properties of clouds due to climate change are considered in the feedback component. Each of these components contributes the largest portion of uncertainty to its relevant category and is largely studied separately from the other. In this paper, using idealized cloud resolving, radiative-convective-equilibrium simulations, with a slab ocean model, we show that aerosol-cloud interactions could significantly affect cloud feedback. Specifically, we show that equilibrium climate sensitivity increases under high aerosol concentration due to an increase in the shortwave cloud feedback. The shortwave cloud feedback is enhanced under high aerosol conditions due to a stronger increase in the precipitation efficiency with warming, which can be explained by higher sensitivity of the droplet size and the cloud water content to the CO2 concentration rise. These results indicate a strong connection between cloud feedback and aerosol-cloud interactions.},

Here we present for the first time a proof of concept for an emulation-based method that uses a large-eddy simulations (LESs) to present sub-grid cloud processes in a general circulation model (GCM). We focus on two key variables affecting the properties of shallow marine clouds: updraft velocity and precipitation formation. The LES is able to describe these processes with high resolution accounting for the realistic variability in cloud properties. We show that the selected emulation method is able to represent the LES outcome with relatively good accuracy and that the updraft velocity and precipitation emulators can be coupled with the GCM practically without increasing the computational costs. We also show that the emulators influence the climate simulated by the GCM but do not consistently improve or worsen the agreement with observations on cloud-related properties, although especially the updraft velocity at cloud base is better captured. A more quantitative evaluation of the emulator impacts against observations would, however, have required model re-tuning, which is a significant task and thus could not be included in this proof-of-concept study. All in all, the approach introduced here is a promising candidate for representing detailed cloud- and aerosol-related sub-grid processes in GCMs. Further development work together with increasing computing capacity can be expected to improve the accuracy and the applicability of the approach in climate simulations.},

July cloud cover is simulated at three locations over the subtropical northeast Pacific Ocean, which are typified by cold sea surface temperatures (SSTs) under well‐mixed stratocumulus, cool SSTs under decoupled stratocumulus, and shallow cumulus clouds overlying warmer SSTs. The idealized climate change includes a uniform 2 K SST increase with corresponding moist‐adiabatic warming aloft and subsidence changes, but no change in free‐tropospheric relative humidity, surface wind speed, or CO2. For each case, realistic advective forcings and boundary conditions are generated for the control and perturbed states which each LES runs for 10 days into a quasi‐steady state. For the control climate, the LESs correctly produce the expected cloud type at all three locations. With the perturbed forcings, all models simulate boundary‐layer deepening due to reduced subsidence in the warmer climate, with less deepening at the warm‐SST location due to regulation by precipitation. The models do not show a consistent response of liquid water path and albedo in the perturbed climate, though the majority predict cloud thickening (negative cloud feedback) at the cold‐SST location and slight cloud thinning (positive cloud feedback) at the cool‐SST and warm‐SST locations. In perturbed climate simulations at the cold‐SST location without the subsidence decrease, cloud albedo consistently decreases across the models. Thus, boundary‐layer cloud feedback on climate change involves compensating thermodynamic and dynamic effects of warming and may interact with patterns of subsidence change. Marine low cloud sensitivity to an idealized climate change is studied The models do not show consistent cloud changes in the perturbed climate Low cloud feedbacks involve cancellation between different effects of warming},

We present some recent developments at the intersection between climate science, mathematics, and physics, which may prove fruitful in the direction of constructing a more comprehensive account of climate dynamics. We describe the Nambu formulation of fluid dynamics and the potential of such a theory for constructing sophisticated numerical models of geophysical fluids. Then, we focus on the statistical mechanics of quasi-equilibrium flows in a rotating environment, which seems crucial for constructing a robust theory of geophysical turbulence. We then discuss ideas and methods suited for approaching directly the nonequilibrium nature of the climate system. First, we describe some recent findings on the thermodynamics of climate, characterize its energy and entropy budgets, and discuss related methods for intercomparing climate models and for studying tipping points. These ideas can also create a common ground between geophysics and astrophysics by suggesting general tools for studying exoplanetary atmospheres. We conclude by focusing on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, which allows for a unified framing of problems as different as the climate response to forcings, the effect of altering the boundary conditions or the coupling between geophysical flows, and the derivation of parametrizations for numerical models.},

Results indicate that the effect of anthropogenic forcing on the DTR is detectable separately from natural forcing across the globe and in many regions. GHG is the dominant contributor to DTR changes and caused the global DTR to decrease by −0.32°C during 1951–2018, close to the observed change of −0.41°C. Decreased anthropogenic aerosols (AER) increased the DTR in Europe, while increased AER decreased the DTR in Asia. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, further decreases in the DTR are likely to be observed in the future. Contrary to rising temperatures, the diurnal temperature range has been decreasing over the past several decades. Although the impacts of humans on global warming have been widely demonstrated, formal detection and attribution of the impacts of human‐made greenhouse gases (GHG) and aerosols on the DTR are still lacking. Our results suggest that human impacts on the DTR are clearly detectable, separately from natural changes. Human‐made greenhouse gases are the dominant factor controlling decreases in the DTR worldwide. In contrast, anthropogenic aerosols (AER) are the dominant contributor for Europe and have led to an abnormal increase in the DTR in this region. If human emissions continue, we expect to see further decreases in the DTR in most regions. Our first quantification of human impacts on the global and regional DTR has significant implications for climate change assessments and future climate projections.

The retrieval is based on the intimate relationship between the cloud drop number concentration, the vertical air motion at cloud base, and the CCN activation spectrum parameters. The CCN properties that are sought are the C and k parameters in the N = CSk relationship, although activation spectra based on the lognormal distribution of particles is also straightforward. Cloud droplet concentration at cloud base is retrieved from a Doppler cloud radar combined with a microwave radiometer following a previously published technique. Cloud base is determined from a lidar or ceilometer. Vertical velocity just above cloud base is determined from the vertically pointing Doppler cloud radar. By combining the simultaneous retrievals of drop number and vertical velocity, and assuming theoretical relationships between these parameters and the subcloud aerosol parameters, the C parameter can be derived, under the assumption of a fixed k. If a calibrated backscatter lidar measurement is available, retrieval of both C and k parameters is possible. The retrieval is demonstrated for a dataset acquired during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment using a least squares minimization technique. Sensitivity to assumptions used in the retrieval is investigated. It is suggested that this technique may afford the acquisition of long-term datasets for climate monitoring purposes. Further investigation with focused experiments designed to address the issue more rigorously is required.},

No model shows a significant positive all-sky RF. The corresponding clear-sky RF is −0.68 Wm−2. The cloud-sky RF was derived based on all-sky and clear-sky RF and modelled cloud cover. It was significantly different from zero and ranged between −0.16 and +0.34 Wm−2. A sensitivity analysis shows that the total aerosol RF is influenced by considerable diversity in simulated residence times, mass extinction coefficients and most importantly forcing efficiencies (forcing per unit optical depth). The clear-sky forcing efficiency (forcing per unit optical depth) has diversity comparable to that for the all-sky/ clear-sky forcing ratio. While the diversity in clear-sky forcing efficiency is impacted by factors such as aerosol absorption, size, and surface albedo, we can show that the all-sky/clear-sky forcing ratio is important because all-sky forcing estimates require proper representation of cloud fields and the correct relative altitude placement between absorbing aerosol and clouds. The analysis of the sulphate RF shows that long sulphate residence times are compensated by low mass extinction coefficients and vice versa. This is explained by more sulphate particle humidity growth and thus higher extinction in those models where short-lived sulphate is present at lower altitude and vice versa. Solar atmospheric forcing within the atmospheric column is estimated at +0.82±0.17 Wm−2. The local annual average maxima of atmospheric forcing exceed +5 Wm−2 confirming the regional character of aerosol impacts on climate. The annual average surface forcing is −1.02±0.23 Wm−2. With the current uncertainties in the modelling of the radiative forcing due to the direct aerosol effect we show here that an estimate from one model is not sufficient but a combination of several model estimates is necessary to provide a mean and to explore the uncertainty.},

Estimation of high‐dimensional parameter sets is an important problem within the hydrological sciences. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient‐based estimation techniques for high‐dimensional inverse estimation problems using a conceptual rainfall‐runoff model. In particular, we compare the effectiveness of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and automatic differentiation variational inference against two nongradient‐dependent methods, random walk Metropolis and differential evolution Metropolis. We show that the former two techniques exhibit superior performance for inverse estimation of daily rainfall values and are much more computationally efficient on larger data sets in an experiment with synthetic data. We also present a case study evaluating the effectiveness of automatic differentiation variational inference for inverse estimation over 25 years of daily precipitation conditional on streamflow observations at three catchments and show that it is scalable to very high dimensional parameter spaces. The presented results highlight the power of combining hydrological process‐based models with optimization techniques from deep learning for high‐dimensional estimation problems. We programmed a rainfall‐runoff model in a software package designed for optimizing neural networks and found that this enabled application of these tools for estimating unknown parameters of our model. Using simulated data, we compared the effectiveness of two methods employing this technique with two which did not and found that the former were much more effective at estimating large numbers of unknown variables. A case study involving 25 years of data from three catchments was also performed in order to assess the viability of this approach on real‐world data. Gradient‐based methods of parameter estimation are used by the deep learning community for high‐dimensional parameter estimation We demonstrate gradient‐based optimization via automatic differentiation using the rainfall‐runoff model GR4J implemented in Theano We show that two gradient‐based methods outperform nongradient methods and are scalable to high‐dimensional parameter spaces},

	abstract = {Using large‐eddy simulations (LES) systematically has the potential to inform parameterizations of subgrid‐scale (SGS) processes in general circulation models (GCMs), such as turbulence, convection, and clouds. Here we show how LES can be run to simulate grid columns of GCMs to generate LES across a cross‐section of dynamical regimes. The LES setup approximately replicates the thermodynamic and water budgets in GCM grid columns. Resolved horizontal and vertical transports of heat and water and large‐scale pressure gradients from the GCM are prescribed as forcing in the LES. The LES are forced with prescribed surface temperatures, but atmospheric temperature and moisture are free to adjust, reducing the imprinting of GCM fields on the LES. In both the GCM and LES, radiative transfer is treated in a unified but idealized manner (semi‐gray atmosphere without water vapor feedback or cloud radiative effects). We show that the LES in this setup reaches statistically steady states without nudging to thermodynamic GCM profiles. The steady states provide training data for developing GCM parameterizations. The same LES setup also provides a good basis for studying the cloud response to global warming. Clouds and their feedbacks remain one of the largest uncertainties in predictions of future climate changes. High‐resolution models can provide faithful simulations of clouds and their underlying turbulence in limited areas, but they have primarily been used in select locations, with limited success in reducing uncertainties in climate predictions. This study presents a framework for driving high‐resolution simulations by a global climate model, which allows us to generate a library of high‐resolution simulations across different cloud regimes. The framework leverages the potential of high‐resolution models to improve parameterizations of clouds and turbulence in climate models and to better understand the cloud feedback mechanisms. A framework in which LES is driven by large‐scale forcing from a GCM is developed LES with large‐scale forcing reaches steady states without nudging to thermodynamic GCM profiles LES driven by the GCM is used to simulate different tropical cloud regimes across the Walker circulation},

	abstract = {Emissions pathways used in climate policy analysis are often derived from integrated assessment models. However, such emissions pathways do not typically include climate feedbacks on socioeconomic systems and by extension do not consider climate uncertainty in their construction. We use a well-known cost-benefit integrated assessment model, the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model, with its climate component replaced by the Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v2.1). The climate uncertainty in FaIR is sampled with an ensemble that is consistent with historically observed climate and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed ranges of key climate variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). By varying discounting assumptions, three scenarios are produced: a pathway similar to the ‘optimal welfare’ scenario of DICE that has similar warming outcomes to current policies, and pathways that limit warming to ‘well-below’ 2 ∘C and 1.5 ∘C with a short-term overshoot, aiming to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals. Climate uncertainty alone is responsible for a factor of five variation (5\%–95\% range) in the social cost of carbon (SCC) in the 1.5 ∘C overshoot scenario, with the spread in SCC increasing in relative terms with increasing stringency of climate target. CO2 emissions trajectories resulting from the optimal level of emissions abatement in all pathways are also sensitive to climate uncertainty, with 2050 emissions ranging from −12 to +14 GtCO2 yr−1 in the 1.5 ∘C scenario. ECS and the strength of present-day aerosol effective radiative forcing are strong determinants of SCC and mid-century CO2 emissions. This shows that narrowing climate uncertainty leads to more refined estimates for the social cost of carbon and provides more certainty about the optimal rate of emissions abatement. Including climate and climate uncertainty in integrated assessment model derived emissions scenarios would address a key missing feedback in scenario construction.},

An emerging class of weather models based on neural networks overcome these limitations by learning the required transformations from data instead of relying on hand-coded physics and by running efficiently in parallel. Here we present a neural network capable of predicting precipitation at a high resolution up to 12 h ahead. The model predicts raw precipitation targets and outperforms for up to 12 h of lead time state-of-the-art physics-based models currently operating in the Continental United States. The results represent a substantial step towards validating the new class of neural weather models. Can AI learn from atmospheric data and improve weather forecasting?

	abstract = {This review summarizes the inverse methods used to estimate the net aerosol forcing inferred from the historical climate change records for the Earth. The available methods are similar in design while differing in their assumptions. Primary differences are (a) the complexity of the earth system model used for forward simulations of the historical period ({\textasciitilde} 1850 to the present), (b) the uncertainty sampling methodology, and (c) the representation of internal climate variability in the statistical approach. All methods, in some fashion, include the net aerosol radiative forcing as a residual forcing that is scaled to find simulations that match the observed records of surface air and deep ocean temperatures. Inverse methods also require sampling the model response uncertainty in the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response (i.e., the delay due to mixing heat into the deep ocean), and therefore, a joint probability distribution is estimated that includes uncertainty across multiple components. The resulting estimates of the net aerosol forcing and its uncertainty are, by construction, necessarily linked to the earth system model, its response characteristics, and the estimates of the internal chaotic variability. Summary results indicate that the net aerosol forcing during the late twentieth century was − 0.77 Wm−2 with a 5–95\% range of − 1.15 to − 0.31 Wm−2 based on 19 results from simple- to full-complexity climate system models.},

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

They are widely used because they are simple, flexible, and provide accurate estimates. GPs are based on a Bayesian statistical framework which provides a posterior probability function for each estimation. Therefore, besides the usual prediction (given in this case by the mean function), GPs come equipped with the possibility to obtain a predictive variance (i.e., error bars, confidence intervals) for each prediction. Unfortunately, the GP formulation usually assumes that there is no noise in the inputs, only in the observations. However, this is often not the case in earth observation problems where an accurate assessment of the measuring instrument error is typically available, and where there is huge interest in characterizing the error propagation through the processing pipeline. In this letter, we demonstrate how one can account for input noise estimates using a GP model formulation which propagates the error terms using the derivative of the predictive mean function. We analyze the resulting predictive variance term and show how they more accurately represent the model error in a temperature prediction problem from infrared sounding data.},

The result is an analytical formulation describing the SSA production fluxes for particles with Dp between 10 nm and 10 μm.

The computed annual global production of SSA is between 6700 and 7400 Tg/year. Comparison of the SILAM near‐surface SSA concentrations and its wet deposition with the in situ EMEP observations showed good agreement for summer periods while in winter time the model tends to under‐estimate the wet deposition by a factor of ∼3. The underestimation is attributed to the coarse fraction (Dp {\textgreater} 10 μm) and the spume production mechanism, which were excluded from the analysis, to the wet deposition parameterization in SILAM and to the under‐estimated precipitation amount in the input meteodata.

ECHAM5-HAM predicts the evolution of an ensemble of microphysically interacting internally- and externally-mixed aerosol populations as well as their size-distribution and composition. The size-distribution is represented by a superposition of log-normal modes. In the current setup, the major global aerosol compounds sulfate (SU), black carbon (BC), particulate organic matter (POM), sea salt (SS), and mineral dust (DU) are included.

An extensive evaluation with in-situ and remote sensing measurements underscores that the model results are generally in good agreement with observations of the global aerosol system. The simulated global annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) is with 0.14 in excellent agreement with an estimate derived from AERONET measurements (0.14) and a composite derived from MODIS-MISR satellite retrievals (0.16).

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

	abstract = {By regulating the global transport of heat, freshwater, and carbon, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) serves as an important component of the climate system. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, indirect observations and models suggest a weakening of the AMOC. Direct AMOC observations also suggest a weakening during the early 21st century but with substantial interannual variability. Long-term weakening of the AMOC has been associated with increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs), but some modeling studies suggest the build up of anthropogenic aerosols (AAs) may have offset part of the GHG-induced weakening. Here, we quantify 1900–2020 AMOC variations and assess the driving mechanisms in state-of-the-art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). The CMIP6 forcing (GHGs, anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols, solar variability, and land use and land change) multi-model mean shows negligible AMOC changes up to ∼ 1950, followed by robust AMOC strengthening during the second half of the 20th century (∼ 1950–1990) and weakening afterwards (1990–2020). These multi-decadal AMOC variations are related to changes in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation, including an altered sea level pressure gradient, storm track activity, surface winds, and heat fluxes, which drive changes in the subpolar North Atlantic surface density flux. To further investigate these AMOC relationships, we perform a regression analysis and decompose these North Atlantic climate responses into an anthropogenic aerosol-forced component and a subsequent AMOC-related feedback. Similar to previous studies, CMIP6 GHG simulations yield robust AMOC weakening, particularly during the second half of the 20th century. Changes in natural forcings, including solar variability and volcanic aerosols, yield negligible AMOC changes. In contrast, CMIP6 AA simulations yield robust AMOC strengthening (weakening) in response to increasing (decreasing) anthropogenic aerosols. Moreover, the CMIP6 all-forcing AMOC variations and atmospheric circulation responses also occur in the CMIP6 AA simulations, which suggests these are largely driven by changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions. More specifically, our results suggest that AMOC multi-decadal variability is initiated by North Atlantic aerosol optical thickness perturbations to net surface shortwave radiation and sea surface temperature (and hence sea surface density), which in turn affect sea level pressure gradient and surface wind and – via latent and sensible heat fluxes – sea surface density flux through its thermal component. AMOC-related feedbacks act to reinforce this aerosol-forced AMOC response, largely due to changes in sea surface salinity (and hence sea surface density), with temperature-related (and cloud-related) feedbacks acting to mute the initial response. Although aspects of the CMIP6 all-forcing multi-model mean response resembles observations, notable differences exist. This includes CMIP6 AMOC strengthening from ∼ 1950 to 1990, when the indirect estimates suggest AMOC weakening. The CMIP6 multi-model mean also underestimates the observed increase in North Atlantic ocean heat content, and although the CMIP6 North Atlantic atmospheric circulation responses – particularly the overall patterns – are similar to observations, the simulated responses are weaker than those observed, implying they are only partially externally forced. The possible causes of these differences include internal climate variability, observational uncertainties, and model shortcomings, including excessive aerosol forcing. A handful of CMIP6 realizations yield AMOC evolution since 1900 similar to the indirect observations, implying the inferred AMOC weakening from 1950 to 1990 (and even from 1930 to 1990) may have a significant contribution from internal (i.e., unforced) climate variability. Nonetheless, CMIP6 models yield robust, externally forced AMOC changes, the bulk of which are due to anthropogenic aerosols.},

Here we present a refined decomposition that separately considers changes in free tropospheric and low cloud properties, better connecting feedbacks to individual governing processes and avoiding ambiguities present in a commonly used decomposition. It reveals that three net cloud feedback components are robustly nonzero: positive feedbacks from increasing free tropospheric cloud altitude and decreasing low cloud cover and a negative feedback from increasing low cloud optical depth. Low cloud amount feedback is the dominant contributor to spread in net cloud feedback but its anticorrelation with other components damps overall spread. The ensemble mean free tropospheric cloud altitude feedback is roughly 60\% as large as the standard cloud altitude feedback because it avoids aliasing in low cloud reductions. Implications for the “null hypothesis” climate sensitivity from well‐understood and robustly simulated feedbacks are discussed. Three robust cloud feedbacks in GCMs: low amount, low optical depth, and non‐low altitude Positive feedback from rising non‐low clouds is smaller and better constrained than commonly quoted Low cloud amount feedback is single largest contributor to spread in net cloud feedback},

	abstract = {Abstract The sensitivity of cloud feedbacks to atmospheric model parameters is evaluated using a CAM6 perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE). The CAM6 PPE perturbs 45 parameters across 262 simulations, 206 of which are used here. The spread in the total cloud feedback and its six components across the CAM6 PPE are comparable to the spread across the CMIP6 and AMIP ensembles, indicating that parametric uncertainty mirrors structural uncertainty. However, the high-cloud altitude feedback is generally larger in the CAM6 PPE than WCRP assessment, CMIP6, and AMIP values. We evaluate the influence of each of the 45 parameters on the total cloud feedback and each of the six cloud feedback components. We also explore whether the CAM6 PPE can be used to constrain the total cloud feedback, with inconclusive results. Further, we find that despite the large parametric sensitivity of cloud feedbacks in CAM6, a substantial increase in cloud feedbacks from CAM5 to CAM6 is not a result of changes in parameter values. Notably, the CAM6 PPE is run with a more recent version of CAM6 (CAM6.3) than was used for AMIP (CAM6.0) and has a smaller total cloud feedback (0.56 W m −2 K −1 ) as compared to CAM6.0 (0.81 W m −2 K −1 ) owing primarily to reductions in low clouds over the tropics and midlatitudes. The work highlights the large sensitivity of cloud feedbacks to both parameter values and structural details in CAM6.},

The main point of contention is the nature of the relationship between global SO2 emissions and In contrast to the concave (log-linear) relationship used by Stevens and in earlier studies, whereby becomes progressively less sensitive to SO2 emissions, some models suggest a convex relationship, which would imply a less negative lower bound. The model that best exemplifies this difference, and that is most clearly in conflict with the hypothesis of Stevens, does so because of an implausible aerosol response to the initial rise in anthropogenic aerosol precursor emissions in East and South Asia—already in 1975 this model’s clear-sky reflectance from anthropogenic aerosol over the North Pacific exceeds present-day estimates of the clear-sky reflectance by the total aerosol. The authors perform experiments using a new (observationally constrained) climatology of anthropogenic aerosols to further show that the effects of changing patterns of aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions during the late twentieth century have, for the same global emissions, relatively little effect on These findings suggest that the behavior Kretzschmar et al. identify as being in conflict with the lower bound in Stevens arises from an implausible relationship between SO2 emissions and and thus provides little basis for revising this lower bound.},

Incorporating equivariance to a new group requires implementing only the group exponential and logarithm maps, enabling rapid prototyping.

	abstract = {While the higher mean Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) in CMIP6 has been attributed to more positive cloud feedbacks, it is unclear what causes the greater range of ECS values across CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5. Here, we investigate the relationship between radiative forcing and cloud feedbacks across the two model generations to explain the very high ECS values in some CMIP6 models. The relationship is sensitive to the definition of the forcing, particularly in CMIP6, but fixed‐sea surface temperature simulations suggest the shortwave cloud feedback (λSW,CL) is anticorrelated with the forcing in CMIP5 and either uncorrelated or weakly positively correlated with the forcing in CMIP6. These relationships reflect the cloud adjustment to the forcing, which is anticorrelated with λSW,CL in CMIP5 and positively correlated in CMIP6. Although we are unable to identify a systematic change across the model generations, we do show that the difference is not due to land effects, and that cloud adjustments are generally driven by low and, especially, midlevel clouds. Furthermore, models derived from a small number modeling centers seem to be responsible for much of the difference between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles. Our analysis is severely limited by the available simulations, highlighting the need for targeted experiments to better understand cloud adjustments and to probe the sources of intermodel differences. This study investigates what caused several of the latest generation of climate models to have very high Equilibrium Climate Sensitivities (ECSs) of over 5°C. We show that the explanation depends on how the radiative forcing from CO2 (F) is calculated. Using the best available estimates of F, we find that in previous model generations F is anticorrelated with models' climate feedback, damping the range of ECS, but in the newest generation of models F is positively correlated with the feedback, increasing the range of ECS. These relationships are driven by correlations between F and the cloud adjustments to the forcing (changes in clouds that are independent of surface temperature), which also change sign between the model generations. Few models provided the necessary data to calculate cloud adjustments, making it difficult to identify systematic differences between the generations, but we are able to trace the difference to models' atmospheric physics, rather than changes in land properties. Most of the intergenerational differences also seem to come from models originally derived from a small number of modeling centers, so that better understanding the cloud adjustments in a few models may explain the greater spread of ECS in the latest generation of climate models. The relationship between feedback and forcing is sensitive to the definition of the forcing, especially in CMIP6 Cloud adjustments are anticorrelated with SW cloud feedbacks in CMIP5 and positively correlated in CMIP6 Changes in cloud adjustments due to land effects are not responsible for these trends The relationship between feedback and forcing is sensitive to the definition of the forcing, especially in CMIP6 Cloud adjustments are anticorrelated with SW cloud feedbacks in CMIP5 and positively correlated in CMIP6 Changes in cloud adjustments due to land effects are not responsible for these trends},

The number concentration of CCN at five supersaturations (∼0.07\% to ∼0.5\%) is predicted from measurements of aerosol size distribution, composition, and hygroscopic growth and is compared to measured CCN concentrations. It is shown that CCN can be predicted quite reliably using measured size distributions, a simple aerosol model to derive the solute-to-water mole ratio, and the diameter growth factor g(RH) or the optical growth factor f(RH). The mean error ranges from an overestimate in CCN of ≤5\% at high supersaturation to a factor of 2.4 at low supersaturation with regression coefficients r2 of 0.90 and 0.53, respectively. The poor agreement at low supersaturation is primarily a result of high flow rates in the CCN counter that prevented small particles from growing to detectable sizes. Precise knowledge of the temperature gradient, and flow rates of the instrument, is essential to establish the correct supersaturation, particularly at low supersaturation, where errors translate into a large percentage of the activated number. There may also be some contribution from simplified composition assumptions, e.g., neglecting variability with size and/or mixing state. The mostly oxygenated organic aerosol could be modeled as insoluble, within the above uncertainties, from the point of view of hygroscopicity and activation.

Further, radiative forcing, a widely used climate response proxy, fails as an effective predictor of global-mean cooling for national-scale aerosol emissions in our simulations; global-mean forcing-to-cooling efficacy differs fivefold depending on emitting region.

Here, we present an observation-based study of the time period 1964 to 2010, which does not rely on climate models. The method incorporates observations of greenhouse gas concentrations, temperature and radiation from approximately 1,300 surface sites into an energy balance framework. Statistical methods commonly applied to economic time series are then used to decompose observed temperature trends into components attributable to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and surface radiation. We find that surface radiation trends, which have been largely explained by changes in atmospheric aerosol loading, caused a cooling that masked approximately one-third of the continental warming due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations over the past half-century. In consequence, the method yields a higher transient climate sensitivity (2.0 ± 0.8 K) than other observational studies.},

To quantify the undetected layer AOD (ULA), an unconstrained retrieval is applied globally using a lidar ratio of 28.75 sr estimated from constrained retrievals during the daytime over the ocean. We find a global mean ULA of 0.031 ± 0.052. There is no significant difference in ULA between land and ocean. However, the fraction of undetected aerosol layers rises considerably during daytime, when the large amount of solar background noise lowers the signal‐to‐noise ratio. For this reason, there is a difference in ULA between day (0.036 ± 0.066) and night (0.025 ± 0.021). ULA is larger in the northern hemisphere and relatively larger at high latitudes. Large ULA for the polar regions is strongly related to the cases where the CALIOP level 2 product reports zero AOD. This study provides an estimate of the complement of AOD that is not detected by lidar and bounds the CALIOP AOD uncertainty to provide corrections for science studies that employ the CALIOP level 2 AOD. Global mean (median) lidar ratio for undetected layers is found as 32.62 (28.75) sr from the MODIS AOD‐constrained retrieval Global mean ULA retrieved using the lidar ratio of 28.75 sr is 0.031 ± 0.052 ULA is very sensitive to the lidar ratio which a significant source of error},

A novel aspect of this work is the use of an artificial neural network pattern identification technique, known as self‐organizing maps, to objectively identify characteristic potential temperature profiles that span the range of profiles present in the 2 year study period.

The pattern‐averaged winds show distinct and physically consistent relationships with the potential temperature profiles. The strongest winds occur for the nearly well mixed but slightly stable patterns and the weakest winds occur for the strongest inversion patterns. The weakest wind shear over the depth of the tower occurs for slightly unstable profiles and the largest wind shear occurs for moderately strong inversions. Pattern‐averaged log wind profiles are consistent with theoretical expectations.

	abstract = {Atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols play an important role in the climate system by influencing the Earth's radiation budgets and modifying the cloud properties. Despite the importance, their representations in large-scale atmospheric models are still crude, which can influence model simulated burden, lifetime, physical, chemical and optical properties, and the climate forcing of carbonaceous aerosols. In this study, we improve the current three-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM3) in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) by introducing an additional primary carbon mode to explicitly account for the microphysical ageing of primary carbonaceous aerosols in the atmosphere. Compared to MAM3, the four-mode version of MAM (MAM4) significantly increases the column burdens of primary particulate organic matter (POM) and black carbon (BC) by up to 40 \% in many remote regions, where in-cloud scavenging plays an important role in determining the aerosol concentrations. Differences in the column burdens for other types of aerosol (e.g., sulfate, secondary organic aerosols, mineral dust, sea salt) are less than 1 \%. Evaluating the MAM4 simulation against in situ surface and aircraft observations, we find that MAM4 significantly improves the simulation of seasonal variation of near-surface BC concentrations in the polar regions, by increasing the BC concentrations in all seasons and particularly in cold seasons. However, it exacerbates the overestimation of modeled BC concentrations in the upper troposphere in the Pacific regions. The comparisons suggest that, to address the remaining model POM and BC biases, future improvements are required related to (1) in-cloud scavenging and vertical transport in convective clouds and (2) emissions of anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols.},

A significant extension of the prewarning time would be instrumental for avoiding some of the worst damages such as harvest failures in developing countries. Here we introduce a unique avenue toward El Niño prediction based on network methods, inspecting emerging teleconnections. Our approach starts from the evidence that a large-scale cooperative mode--linking the El Niño basin (equatorial Pacific corridor) and the rest of the ocean--builds up in the calendar year before the warming event. On this basis, we can develop an efficient 12-mo forecasting scheme, i.e., achieve some doubling of the early-warning period. Our method is based on high-quality observational data available since 1950 and yields hit rates above 0.5, whereas false-alarm rates are below 0.1.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosol emissions have increased considerably over the last century, but climate effects and quantification of the emissions are highly uncertain as one goes back in time. This uncertainty is partly due to a lack of observations in the pre-satellite era, making the observations we do have before 1990 additionally valuable. Aerosols suspended in the atmosphere scatter and absorb incoming solar radiation and thereby alter the Earth's surface energy balance. Previous studies show that Earth system models (ESMs) do not adequately represent surface energy fluxes over the historical era. We investigated global and regional aerosol effects over the time period 1961–2014 by looking at surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SDSR). We used observations from ground stations as well as multiple experiments from eight ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 6 (CMIP6). Our results show that this subset of models reproduces the observed transient SDSR well in Europe but poorly in China. We suggest that this may be attributed to missing emissions of sulfur dioxide in China, sulfur dioxide being a precursor to sulfate, which is a highly reflective aerosol and responsible for more reflective clouds. The emissions of sulfur dioxide used in the models do not show a temporal pattern that could explain observed SDSR evolution over China. The results from various aerosol emission perturbation experiments from DAMIP, RFMIP and AerChemMIP show that only simulations containing anthropogenic aerosol emissions show dimming, even if the dimming is underestimated. Simulated clear-sky and all-sky SDSR do not differ greatly, suggesting that cloud cover changes are not a dominant cause of the biased SDSR evolution in the simulations. Therefore we suggest that the discrepancy between modeled and observed SDSR evolution is partly caused by erroneous aerosol and aerosol precursor emission inventories. This is an important finding as it may help interpret whether ESMs reproduce the historical climate evolution for the right or wrong reason.},

Using multiple characteristics of Sahel precipitation, we construct a multivariate fingerprint that allows us to distinguish between the model-predicted responses to greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols. Models project the emergence of a detectable signal of aerosol forcing in the middle of the 20th century and a detectable signal of greenhouse gas forcing at the beginning of the 21st. However, the signals of both aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing in observations emerge earlier and are stronger than in the models, far stronger in the case of aerosols. The similarity between the response to aerosol forcing and the leading mode of internal variability makes it difficult to attribute this model-observation discrepancy to errors in the forcing, errors in the forced response, model inability to capture the amplitude of internal variability, or some combination of these. For greenhouse gases, however, the forced response is distinct from internal variability as estimated by models, and the observations are largely commensurate with the model projections.},

	abstract = {Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol‐radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol‐driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed‐phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68\% confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of ‐1.6 to ‐0.6 W m−2, or ‐2.0 to ‐0.4 W m−2 with a 90\% likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial‐era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds. Human activities emit into the atmosphere small liquid and solid particles called aerosols. Those aerosols change the energy budget of the Earth and trigger climate changes, by scattering and absorbing solar and terrestrial radiation and playing important roles in the formation of cloud droplets and ice crystals. But because aerosols are much more varied in their chemical composition and much more heterogeneous in their spatial and temporal distributions than greenhouse gases, their perturbation to the energy budget, called radiative forcing, is much more uncertain. This review uses traceable and arguable lines of evidence, supported by aerosol studies published over the past 40 years, to quantify that uncertainty. It finds that there are two chances out of three that aerosols from human activities have increased scattering and absorption of solar radiation by 14\% to 29\% and cloud droplet number concentration by 5 to 17\% in the period 2005–2015 compared to the year 1850. Those increases exert a radiative forcing that offsets between a fifth and a half of the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. The degree to which human activities affect natural aerosol levels, and the response of clouds, and especially ice clouds, to aerosol perturbations remain particularly uncertain. An assessment of multiple lines of evidence supported by a conceptual model provides ranges for aerosol radiative forcing of climate change Aerosol effective radiative forcing is assessed to be between ‐1.6 and ‐0.6 W m−2 at the 16–84\% confidence level Although key uncertainties remain, new ways of using observations provide stronger constraints for models},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the effects of clouds in GCMs have been represented by semiempirical parameterizations. Recently, a cloud-resolving model (CRM) was embedded into each grid column of a realistic GCM, the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), to serve as a superparameterization (SP) of clouds. Results of the standard CAM and the SP-CAM are contrasted, both using T42 resolution (2.8° × 2.8° grid), 26 vertical levels, and up to a 500-day-long simulation. The SP was based on a two-dimensional (2D) CRM with 64 grid columns and 24 levels collocated with the 24 lowest levels of CAM. In terms of the mean state, the SP-CAM produces quite reasonable geographical distributions of precipitation, precipitable water, top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes, cloud radiative forcing, and high-cloud fraction for both December–January–February and June–July–August. The most notable and persistent precipitation bias in the western Pacific, during the Northern Hemisphere summer of all the SP-CAM runs with 2D SP, seems to go away through the use of a small-domain three-dimensional (3D) SP with the same number of grid columns as the 2D SP, but arranged in an 8 × 8 square with identical horizontal resolution of 4 km. Two runs with the 3D SP have been carried out, with and without explicit large-scale momentum transport by convection. Interestingly, the double ITCZ feature seems to go away in the run that includes momentum transport. The SP improves the diurnal variability of nondrizzle precipitation frequency over the standard model by precipitating most frequently during late afternoon hours over the land, as observed, while the standard model maximizes its precipitation frequency around local solar noon. Over the ocean, both models precipitate most frequently in the early morning hours as observed. The SP model also reproduces the observed global distribution of the percentage of days with nondrizzle precipitation rather well. In contrast, the standard model tends to precipitate more frequently, on average by about 20\%–30\%. The SP model seems to improve the convective intraseasonal variability over the standard model. Preliminary results suggest that the SP produces more realistic variability of such fields as 200-mb wind and OLR, relative to the control, including the often poorly simulated Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO).},

Our study considers a variety of observations: ground-site or in situ remote sensing (PM2. 5, black carbon mass or number concentrations), satellite remote sensing with imagers or lidar (extinction). We show that observational coverage (a measure of how dense the spatio-temporal sampling of the observations is) is not an effective metric to limit representation errors. Different strategies to construct monthly gridded satellite L3 data are assessed and temporal averaging of spatially aggregated observations (super-observations) is found to be the best, although it still allows for significant representation errors. However, temporal collocation of data (possible when observations are compared to model data or other observations), combined with temporal averaging, can be very effective at reducing representation errors. We also show that ground-based and wide-swath imager satellite remote sensing data give rise to similar representation errors, although their observational sampling is different. Finally, emission sources and orography can lead to representation errors that are very hard to reduce, even with substantial temporal averaging.},

As such, attempts to emulate them using machine learning should reflect this. While the use of machine learning to emulate weather forecast models is a relatively new endeavour, there is a rich history of climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is an initial condition problem, which intimately depends on the current state of the atmosphere, climate modelling is predominantly a boundary condition problem. To emulate the response of the climate to different drivers therefore, representation of the full dynamical evolution of the atmosphere is neither necessary, or in many cases, desirable. Climate scientists are typically interested in different questions also. Indeed emulating the steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g. parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the large datasets, non-linear relationships and limited training data make climate a domain which is rich in interesting machine learning challenges. Here, I seek to set out the current state of climate model emulation and demonstrate how, despite some challenges, recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for creating useful statistical models of the climate.

Here we apply novel techniques to diagnose the contributors to the shortwave (SW) effective radiative forcing (ERF) from aerosol-radiation-interaction (ERFari) and from aerosol cloud interaction (ERFaci) in experiments performed in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We find that the ensemble mean SW ERFari+aci of −1.40±0.56 W m−2 comes roughly 25\% from ERFari (−0.35±0.20 W m−2) and 75\% from ERFaci (−1.04±0.67 W m−2). ERFari is made up of −0.62±0.30 W m−2 due to aerosol scattering opposed by +0.26 ± 0.12 W m−2 due to aerosol absorption and is largest near emission sources. The ERFari from nonsulfate aerosols is +0.13 ± 0.09 W m−2, consisting of −0.15±0.11 W m−2 of scattering and +0.29 ± 0.15 W m−2 of absorption. The change in clear-sky flux is a negatively biased measure of ERFari, as the presence of clouds reduces the magnitude and intermodel spread of ERFari by 40–50\%. ERFaci, which is large both near and downwind of emission sources, is composed of −0.99±0.54 W m−2 from enhanced cloud scattering, with much smaller contributions from increased cloud amount and absorption. In models that allow aerosols to affect ice clouds, large increases in the optical depth of high clouds cause substantial longwave and shortwave radiative anomalies. Intermodel spread in ERFaci is dominated by differences in how aerosols increase cloud scattering, but even if all models agreed on this effect, over a fifth of the spread in ERFaci would remain due solely to differences in total cloud amount.},

The pattern scaling technique is used to estimate information on climate change for periods and scenarios not simulated by the regional model. We based our study on regional simulations performed over southern South America for present climate conditions and two emission scenarios at the end of the twenty first century. We used the pattern scaling technique to estimate mean seasonal changes of temperature and precipitation for the 2020s and the 2050s. The validity of the scalability assumptions underlying the pattern scaling technique for estimating near future regional climate change scenarios over southern South America is assessed. The results show that the pattern scaling works well for estimating mean temperature changes for which the regional changes are linearly related to the global mean temperature changes. For precipitation changes, the validity of the scalability assumption is weaker. The errors of estimating precipitation changes are comparable to those inherent to the regional model and to the projected changes themselves.},

Here we study the fundamental process of the development of this volcanic radiative forcing, focusing on the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines on June 15, 1991. We develop a spectral‐, space‐, and time‐dependent set of aerosol parameters for 2 years after the Pinatubo eruption using a combination of SAGE II aerosol extinctions and UARS‐retrieved effective radii, supported by SAM II, AVHRR, lidar and balloon observations. Using these data, we calculate the aerosol radiative forcing with the ECHAM4 general circulation model (GCM) for cases with climatological and observed sea surface temperature (SST), as well as with and without climate response. We find that the aerosol radiative forcing is not sensitive to the climate variations caused by SST or the atmospheric response to the aerosols, except in regions with varying dense cloudiness. The solar forcing in the near infrared contributes substantially to the total stratospheric heating. A complete formulation of radiative forcing should include not only changes of net fluxes at the tropopause but also the vertical distribution of atmospheric heating rates and the change of downward thermal and net solar radiative fluxes at the surface. These forcing and aerosol data are available for GCM experiments with any spatial and spectral resolution.},

	abstract = {This paper documents coupled simulations of two developmental versions of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) towards CAM6. The configuration called CAM5.4 introduces new microphysics, aerosol, and ice nucleation changes, among others to CAM. The CAM5.5 configuration represents a more radical departure, as it uses an assumed probability density function (PDF)-based unified cloud parameterization to replace the turbulence, shallow convection, and warm cloud macrophysics in CAM. This assumed PDF method has been widely used in the last decade in atmosphere-only climate simulations but has never been documented in coupled mode. Here, we compare the simulated coupled climates of CAM5.4 and CAM5.5 and compare them to the control coupled simulation produced by CAM5.3. We find that CAM5.5 has lower cloud forcing biases when compared to the control simulations. Improvements are also seen in the simulated amplitude of the Niño-3.4 index, an improved representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation, subtropical surface wind stresses, and double Intertropical Convergence Zone biases. Degradations are seen in Amazon precipitation as well as slightly colder sea surface temperatures and thinner Arctic sea ice. Simulation of the 20th century results in a credible simulation that ends slightly colder than the control coupled simulation. The authors find this is due to aerosol indirect effects that are slightly stronger in the new version of the model and propose a solution to ameliorate this. Overall, in these early coupled simulations, CAM5.5 produces a credible climate that is appropriate for science applications and is ready for integration into the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR's) next-generation climate model.},

This 2-year study included an intensive field campaign, TexAQS 2006/Gulf of Mexico Atmospheric Composition and Climate Study (GoMACCS), conducted in August–October 2006. The results reported in this special journal section are based on observations collected on four aircraft, one research vessel, networks of ground-based air quality and meteorological (surface and radar wind profiler) sites in eastern Texas, a balloon-borne ozonesonde-radiosonde network (part of Intercontinental Transport Experiment Ozonesonde Network Study (IONS-06)), and satellites. This overview paper provides operational and logistical information for those platforms and sites, summarizes the principal findings and conclusions that have thus far been drawn from the results, and directs readers to appropriate papers for the full analysis. Two of these findings deserve particular emphasis. First, despite decreases in actual emissions of highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) and some improvements in inventory estimates since the TexAQS 2000 study, the current Houston area emission inventories still underestimate HRVOC emissions by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Second, the background ozone in eastern Texas, which represents the minimum ozone concentration that is likely achievable through only local controls, can approach or exceed the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppbv for an 8-h average. These findings have broad implications for air quality control strategies in eastern Texas.},

Past observations have been used to help constrain the range of uncertainties in future warming rates, but under the assumption of a particular scenario of future emissions4. Here we investigate the relative importance of the uncertainty in climate response to a particular emissions scenario versus the uncertainty caused by the differences between future emissions scenarios for our estimates of future change. We present probabilistic forecasts of global-mean temperatures for four representative scenarios for future emissions5, obtained with a comprehensive climate model. We find that, in the absence of policies to mitigate climate change, global-mean temperature rise is insensitive to the differences in the emissions scenarios over the next four decades. We also show that in the future, as the signal of climate change emerges further, the predictions will become better constrained.},

Its major objectives aimed at (i) investigating the extent and persistence of the outflow of pollution from Mexico; (ii) understanding transport and evolution of Asian pollution and implications for air quality and climate across western North America; and (iii) validating space-borne observations of tropospheric composition. INTEX-B was performed in two phases. In its first phase (1–21 March), INTEX-B operated as part of the MILAGRO campaign with a focus on observations over Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. In the second phase (17 April–15 May), the main INTEX-B focus was on trans-Pacific Asian pollution transport. Multiple airborne platforms carrying state of the art chemistry and radiation payloads were flown in concert with satellites and ground stations during the two phases of INTEX-B. Validation of Aura satellite instruments (TES, OMI, MLS, HIRDLS) was a key objective within INTEX-B. Satellite products along with meteorological and 3-D chemical transport model forecasts were integrated into the flight planning process to allow targeted sampling of air parcels. Inter-comparisons were performed among and between aircraft payloads to quantify the accuracy of data and to create a unified data set. Pollution plumes were sampled over the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific several days after downwind transport from source regions. Signatures of Asian pollution were routinely detected by INTEX-B aircraft, providing a valuable data set on gas and aerosol composition to test models and evaluate pathways of pollution transport and their impact on air quality and climate. This overview provides details about campaign implementation and a context within which the present and future INTEX-B/MILAGRO publications can be understood.},

This cooling due to sulfate aerosol offsets some of the warming effect of greenhouse gasses and is the largest uncertainty in determining the change in the Earth’s radiative balance by human activity. Ship tracks—the visible manifestation of the indirect of effect of ship emissions on clouds as quasi-linear features—have long provided an opportunity to quantify these effects. However, they have been arduous to catalog and typically studied only in particular regions for short periods of time. Using a machine-learning algorithm to automate their detection we catalog more than 1 million ship tracks to provide a global climatology. We use this to investigate the effect of stringent fuel regulations introduced by the International Maritime Organization in 2020 on their global prevalence since then, while accounting for the disruption in global commerce caused by COVID-19. We find a marked, but clearly nonlinear, decline in ship tracks globally: An 80\% reduction in SO x emissions causes only a 25\% reduction in the number of tracks detected.},

Measurements show that particle formation in atmospheric conditions can occur solely from biogenic vapors. Here, we evaluate the potential effect of this source of particles on preindustrial cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations and aerosol–cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period. Model simulations show that the pure biogenic particle formation mechanism has a much larger relative effect on CCN concentrations in the preindustrial atmosphere than in the present atmosphere because of the lower aerosol concentrations. Consequently, preindustrial cloud albedo is increased more than under present day conditions, and therefore the cooling forcing of anthropogenic aerosols is reduced. The mechanism increases CCN concentrations by 20–100\% over a large fraction of the preindustrial lower atmosphere, and the magnitude of annual global mean radiative forcing caused by changes of cloud albedo since 1750 is reduced by {\textless}mml:math{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}0.22{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater} {\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}W{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater} {\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}m{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}−{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}2{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}0.22 W m−2 (27\%) to {\textless}mml:math{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}−{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}0.60{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater} {\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}W{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater} {\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}m{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}−{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}2{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}−0.60 W m−2.

However, the gap between theory and practice is gradually starting to close. In this paper I will attempt to assemble some pieces of the remarkable and still incomplete mathematical mosaic emerging from the efforts to understand the foundations of deep learning. The two key themes will be interpolation and its sibling over-parametrization. Interpolation corresponds to fitting data, even noisy data, exactly. Over-parametrization enables interpolation and provides flexibility to select a suitable interpolating model. As we will see, just as a physical prism separates colours mixed within a ray of light, the figurative prism of interpolation helps to disentangle generalization and optimization properties within the complex picture of modern machine learning. This article is written in the belief and hope that clearer understanding of these issues will bring us a step closer towards a general theory of deep learning and machine learning.},

Previous studies have suggested that these changes may have influenced the temperature trends as well as precipitation patterns due to the direct and semidirect aerosol effects. Here, an Earth system model with parameterized aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions is used to investigate changes in cloud properties and precipitation between 1975 and 2005. This is done globally as well as for the two focus areas Europe and East Asia. Despite systematic changes in cloud droplet number concentration and cloud droplet size, changes in stratiform precipitation are less clear. In both regions there is a dominance of autoconversion over liquid water accretion as the primary precipitation release mechanism, which alone should imply a strong sensitivity to changes in cloud droplet size. However, in these areas liquid water paths are relatively low and background concentrations are high, which produce low simulated precipitation susceptibilities. High susceptibilities are instead found over remote ocean regions, in agreement with expectations. For convective precipitation, both regions show statistically significant changes that are consistent with oppositely signed changes in direct aerosol forcing over Europe and East Asia, respectively.},

The framework utilized is an idealized steady-state one-dimensional column rain shaft model with specified column-top rain properties and a fixed thermodynamical profile. Different configurations of BOSS — flexibility being a key feature of this approach — are constrained via synthetic observations generated from a traditional three-moment bulk microphysics scheme. The ability to retrieve correct parameter values when the true parameter values are known is illustrated. For cases when there is no set of true parameter values, the accuracy of configurations of BOSS that have different levels of complexity is compared. It is found that addition of the sixth moment as a prognostic variable improves prediction of the 3rd moment (proportional to bulk rain mass) and rain rate. In contrast, increasing process-rate formulation complexity by adding more power terms has little benefit—a result that is explained using further-idealized experiments. BOSS rain shaft simulations are shown to well estimate the true process rates from constraint by bulk rain observations, with the additional benefit of rigorously quantified uncertainty of these estimates.},

In this work, we examine more than 1000 vertical profiles from 11 major airborne campaigns in the Pacific hemisphere and confirm that regional enhancements in aerosol light scattering, mass, and number are associated with carbon monoxide from combustion and can exceed values in unperturbed regions by more than one order of magnitude. Related regional increases in a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and AOD imply that direct and indirect aerosol radiative effects are coupled issues linked globally to aged combustion. These profiles constrain the influence of combustion on regional AOD and CCN suitable for challenging climate model performance and informing satellite retrievals.},

Here we apply warming patch experiments to a climate model to demonstrate that the spatial pattern of sea surface warming can explain a wide range of η. Warming in tropical strongly ascending regions produces η values even larger than suggested by the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship (7\% K−1), as the warming and moisture increases can propagate vertically and be transported globally through atmospheric dynamics. Differences in warming patterns are as important as different treatments of atmospheric physics in determining the spread of η in climate models. By accounting for the pattern effect, the global-mean precipitation over the past decades can be well reconstructed in terms of both magnitude and variability, indicating the vital role of the pattern effect in estimating future intensification of the hydrological cycle. The drivers of uncertainties in hydrological sensitivity, the global-mean precipitation response to warming, are currently not well understood. Here the authors show that the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature warming explains much of this uncertainty and could allow to constrain projections.},

	abstract = {The stratospheric polar vortex can influence the tropospheric circulation and thereby winter weather in the mid-latitudes. Weak vortex states, often associated with sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW), have been shown to increase the risk of cold-spells especially over Eurasia, but its role for North American winters is less clear. Using cluster analysis, we show that there are two dominant patterns of increased polar cap heights in the lower stratosphere. Both patterns represent a weak polar vortex but they are associated with different wave mechanisms and different regional tropospheric impacts. The first pattern is zonally symmetric and associated with absorbed upward-propagating wave activity, leading to a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and cold-air outbreaks over northern Eurasia. This coupling mechanism is well-documented in the literature and is consistent with the downward migration of the northern annular mode (NAM). The second pattern is zonally asymmetric and linked to downward reflected planetary waves over Canada followed by a negative phase of the Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO) and cold-spells in Central Canada and the Great Lakes region. Causal effect network (CEN) analyses confirm the atmospheric pathways associated with this asymmetric pattern. Moreover, our findings suggest the reflective mechanism to be sensitive to the exact region of upward wave-activity fluxes and to be state-dependent on the strength of the vortex. Identifying the causal pathways that operate on weekly to monthly timescales can pave the way for improved sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting of cold spells in the mid-latitudes. Cold spells in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes are influenced by the stratospheric polar vortex in two different ways. Marlene Kretschmer from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany, and collaborators use cluster analysis to show there are two dominant patterns associated with a weak polar vortex. The first is zonally-symmetric, associated with absorbed upward wave activity fluxes and is linked to a negative North Atlantic Oscillation and cold spells over Eurasia. Whilst the second is zonally-asymmetric, associated with downward reflected waves over Canada and is linked to a negative Western Pacific Oscillation and cold spells over North America. This knowledge could allow better prediction of winter weather on sub- to seasonal scales.},

See Article p.67 Firmly establishing the influence of aerosols on cloud albedo — their forcing effect on climate in essence — is one of the greatest challenges of modern climate science. It is often tacitly assumed that the continued high uncertainties are linked mainly to anthropogenic emissions. In other words, if the anthropogenic effects could be better understood, so would the overall effect. Now Ken Carslaw and colleagues present an analysis of 28 parameters representing aerosol and precursor gas emissions and other factors that could influence cloud brightness. They find that only 34 per cent of the variance in aerosol forcing since pre-industrial times (around 1750) is associated with anthropogenic emissions, with 45 per cent of the variance linked to natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide and other natural sources. This work casts doubts on the degree of progress that can be made solely through advances in the understanding of anthropogenic aerosols and suggests that we need to discover more about the workings of the pre-industrial environment, when natural aerosols were predominant.},

A maximum likelihood evaluation reveals that the distribution of spatiotemporally integrated extreme rainfall cluster sizes over the oceans is best described by a truncated power law, calling into question previous statements about scale-free distributions. The observed subpower law behavior of the distribution's tail is evaluated with a simple generative model, which indicates that the exponential truncation of an otherwise scale-free spatiotemporal cluster size distribution over the oceans could be explained by the existence of land masses on the globe.},

Hydrological modelling indicates this increased extreme 30-day-average Thames river flows, and slightly increased daily peak flows, consistent with the understanding of the catchment’s sensitivity to longer-duration precipitation and changes in the role of snowmelt. Consequently, flood risk mapping shows a small increase in properties in the Thames catchment potentially at risk of riverine flooding, with a substantial range of uncertainty, demonstrating the importance of explicit modelling of impacts and relatively subtle changes in weather-related risks when quantifying present-day effects of human influence on climate.

High temporal-resolution measurements of the chemical composition of the particles were conducted using an airborne compact time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (cToF-AMS). These measurements were performed during two flights from the island of Crete to the island of Lemnos and back. A hygroscopic tandem differential mobility analyser (HTDMA) located on the island of Lemnos was used to measure the ability of the particles to take up water. The HTDMA measurements showed that the particles in the dominant mode were internally mixed, having hygroscopic growth factors that ranged from 1.00 to 1.59 when exposed to 85\% relative humidity. When the aircraft flew near the ground station on Lemnos, the cToF-AMS measurements showed that the organic volume fraction of the particles ranged from 43 to 56\%. These measurements corroborate the range of hygroscopic growth factors measured by the HTDMA during that time. Good closure between HTDMA and cToF-AMS measurements was achieved when assuming that the organic species were less hygroscopic and had an average density that corresponds to aged organic species. Using the results from the closure study, the cToF-AMS measurements were employed to determine vertical profiles of a representative aerosol hygroscopic parameter κmix. Calculated κmix values ranged from 0.19 to 0.84 during the first flight and from 0.22 to 0.80 during the second flight. Air masses of different origin as determined by back trajectory calculations can explain the spatial variation in chemical composition and κmix values of the particles observed in the region.},

Here, we show the energy budget during recent decades can be closed by combining changes in effective radiative forcing, linear radiative damping and this pattern effect. The pattern effect is of comparable magnitude but opposite sign to Earth’s net energy imbalance in the 2000s, indicating its importance when predicting the future climate on the basis of observations. After the pattern effect is accounted for, the best-estimate value of committed global warming at present-day forcing rises from 1.31 K (0.99–2.33 K, 5th–95th percentile) to over 2 K, and committed warming in 2100 with constant long-lived forcing increases from 1.32 K (0.94–2.03 K) to over 1.5 K, although the magnitude is sensitive to sea surface temperature dataset. Further constraints on the pattern effect are needed to reduce climate projection uncertainty. Earth’s energy budget depends on the global sea surface temperature pattern, which is currently counteracting warming more strongly than expected in the future. Including this pattern effect in projections causes committed warming with present-day forcing to exceed the Paris goals, implying less leeway than anticipated.},

Approximately 500 smoke plumes from biomass burning emissions that varied in age from minutes to days were segregated by fire source region and urban emission influences. The normalized excess mixing ratios (NEMR) of gaseous (carbon dioxide, acetonitrile, hydrogen cyanide, toluene, benzene, methane, oxides of nitrogen and ozone) and fine aerosol particulate components (nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride, organic aerosols and water soluble organic carbon) of these plumes were compared. A detailed statistical analysis of the different plume categories for different gaseous and aerosol species is presented in this paper. The comparison of NEMR values showed that CH4 concentrations were higher in air-masses that were influenced by urban emissions. Fresh biomass burning plumes mixed with urban emissions showed a higher degree of oxidative processing in comparison with fresh biomass burning only plumes. This was evident in higher concentrations of inorganic aerosol components such as sulfate, nitrate and ammonium, but not reflected in the organic components. Lower NOx NEMRs combined with high sulfate, nitrate and ammonium NEMRs in aerosols of plumes subject to long-range transport, when comparing all plume categories, provided evidence of advanced processing of these plumes.},

In this article, we study the role of Linkage Learning (LL) performed by GOMEA in Symbolic Regression (SR). We show that the non-uniformity in the distribution of the genotype in GP populations negatively biases LL, and propose a method to correct for this. We also propose approaches to improve LL when ephemeral random constants are used. Furthermore, we adapt a scheme of interleaving runs to alleviate the burden of tuning the population size, a crucial parameter for LL, to SR. We run experiments on 10 real-world datasets, enforcing a strict limitation on solution size, to enable interpretability. We find that the new LL method outperforms the standard one, and that GOMEA outperforms both traditional and semantic GP. We also find that the small solutions evolved by GOMEA are competitive with tuned decision trees, making GOMEA a promising new approach to SR.},

The training targets are the three‐dimensional fields of effective heating and moistening rates, including the effect of grid‐scale motions that are resolved but imperfectly simulated by the coarse model. A neural network is trained to predict the time‐dependent heating and moistening rates in each grid column using the coarse‐grained temperature, specific humidity, surface turbulent heat fluxes, cosine of solar zenith angle, land‐sea mask and surface geopotential of that grid column as inputs. The coefficient of determination R2 for offline prediction ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 at most vertical levels and latitudes. Online, we achieve stable 35‐day simulations, with metrics of skill such as the time‐mean pattern of near‐surface temperature and precipitation comparable or slightly better than a baseline simulation with conventional physical parameterizations. However, the structure of tropical circulation and relative humidity in the upper troposphere are unrealistic. Overall, this study shows potential for the replacement of human‐designed parameterizations with data‐driven ones in a realistic setting. Numerical models used for projecting climate change impacts must use ad‐hoc assumptions about the effects of unresolved small‐scale processes. These assumptions contribute to uncertainty in predicting how rainfall and temperature will change in the future. Expensive fine‐grid simulations which eliminate the need for some of these assumptions are possible to run for shorter (month‐to year‐long) duration. We use such a simulation to train a data‐driven representation of the effects of processes, like clouds, which are poorly simulated by a cheaper coarse‐grid model. The data‐driven representation (a neural network) predicts rates of temperature and moisture change in each column using inputs from that grid column. This approach has been previously shown to work for models with idealized boundary conditions, but not for the realistic setting we use. When this neural network is used in a coarse‐resolution model, the realism of many global skill metrics is as good or better than a baseline model with traditional representation of small‐scale processes. However, some features are degraded, such as the time‐evolving pattern of rainfall in the tropics and humidity in the upper atmosphere. This work is a first step toward the use of data‐driven representations of unresolved processes in realistic global atmospheric models.

Our results show that sampling errors as large as 100 \% in AOT (aerosol optical thickness), 0.4 in AE (Ångström Exponent) and 0.05 in SSA (single scattering albedo) are possible. Even in daily averages, sampling errors can be significant. Moreover these sampling errors are often correlated over long distances giving rise to artificial contrasts between pristine and polluted events and regions. Additionally, we provide evidence that suggests that models will underestimate these errors. To prevent sampling errors, model data should be temporally collocated to the observations before any analysis is made.We also discuss how this work has consequences for in situ measurements (e.g. aircraft campaigns or surface measurements) in model evaluation.Although this study is framed in the context of model evaluation, it has a clear and direct relevance to climatologies derived from observational data sets.},

A regression analysis of an ensemble of coupled climate model simulations shows that this response is, to a large part, shaped by the interaction between ocean and atmosphere. A poleward shift of the mid-latitude storm tracks in response to anthropogenic greenhouse-gas forcing has been diagnosed in climate model simulations1,2. Explanations of this effect have focused on atmospheric dynamics3,4,5,6,7. However, in contrast to storm tracks in other regions, the North Atlantic storm track responds by strengthening and extending farther east, in particular on its southern flank8. These adjustments are associated with an intensification and extension of the eddy-driven jet towards western Europe9 and are expected to have considerable societal impacts related to a rise in storminess in Europe10,11,12. Here, we apply a regression analysis to an ensemble of coupled climate model simulations to show that the coupling between ocean and atmosphere shapes the distinct storm-track response to greenhouse-gas forcing in the North Atlantic region. In the ensemble of simulations we analyse, at least half of the differences between the storm-track responses of different models are associated with uncertainties in ocean circulation changes. We compare the fully coupled simulations with both the associated slab model simulations and an ocean-forced experiment with one climate model to establish causality. We conclude that uncertainties in the response of the North Atlantic storm track to anthropogenic emissions could be reduced through tighter constraints on the future ocean circulation.},

	abstract = {The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5), equipped with a technique to tag black carbon (BC) emissions by source regions and types, has been employed to establish source–receptor relationships for atmospheric BC and its deposition to snow over western North America. The CAM5 simulation was conducted with meteorological fields constrained by reanalysis for year 2013 when measurements of BC in both near-surface air and snow are available for model evaluation. We find that CAM5 has a significant low bias in predicted mixing ratios of BC in snow but only a small low bias in predicted atmospheric concentrations over northwestern USA and western Canada. Even with a strong low bias in snow mixing ratios, radiative transfer calculations show that the BC-in-snow darkening effect is substantially larger than the BC dimming effect at the surface by atmospheric BC. Local sources contribute more to near-surface atmospheric BC and to deposition than distant sources, while the latter are more important in the middle and upper troposphere where wet removal is relatively weak. Fossil fuel (FF) is the dominant source type for total column BC burden over the two regions. FF is also the dominant local source type for BC column burden, deposition, and near-surface BC, while for all distant source regions combined the contribution of biomass/biofuel (BB) is larger than FF. An observationally based positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the snow-impurity chemistry is conducted to quantitatively evaluate the CAM5 BC source-type attribution. While CAM5 is qualitatively consistent with the PMF analysis with respect to partitioning of BC originating from BB and FF emissions, it significantly underestimates the relative contribution of BB. In addition to a possible low bias in BB emissions used in the simulation, the model is likely missing a significant source of snow darkening from local soil found in the observations.},

In this paper we report on the observation of a reduction in the localisation induced S-shape temperature dependence of the peak photoluminescence energy with increasing excitation power density. This S-shape dependence is a key fingerprint of carrier localisation. Over the range of excitation power density where the depth of the S shape is reduced we also observe a reduction in the integrated photoluminescence intensity per unit excitation power, i.e. efficiency droop. Hence the onset of efficiency droop occurs at the same carrier density as the onset of carrier delocalisation. We correlate these experimental results with the predictions of a theoretical model of the effects of carrier localisation due to local variations in the concentration of the randomly distributed In atoms on the optical properties of InGaN/GaN quantum wells. On the basis of this comparison of theory with experiment we attribute the reduction in the Sshape temperature dependence to the saturation of the available localised states. We propose that this saturation of the localised states is a contributory factor to efficiency droop whereby non localised carriers recombine non-radiatively.},

In the SCM set-up, the large-scale tropical circulation is parametrized to respond to the surface temperature departure from a prescribed environment, following the Weak Temperature Gradient (WTG) approximation and using the Damped Gravity Wave (DGW) parametrization. The SCM is also forced with moisture variations. First, it is found that most of the present-day mean tropical rainfall and circulation pattern is associated with TS and RHS patterns. Climate change experiments with the SCM are performed, imposing separately surface warming and CO2 increase. The rainfall response to future changes in sea surface temperature patterns and plant physiology are successfully reproduced, suggesting that these are direct responses to local changes in convective instability. However, the SCM increases oceanic rainfall too much, and fails to reproduce the land rainfall decrease, that are both associated with uniform ocean warming. It is argued that remote atmospheric teleconnections play a crucial role in both weakening the atmospheric overturning circulation and constraining precipitation changes. Results suggest that the overturning circulation weakens, both as a direct local response to increased CO2 and in response to energy-imbalance driven exchanges between ascent and descent regions.},

The uncertainty in future climate due to internal climate variability can be estimated from large ensembles of climate change simulations in which the experiment setup is the same from one ensemble member to the next but for small perturbations in the initial atmospheric state. However, large ensembles are invariably computationally expensive and susceptible to model bias. Here the authors outline an alternative approach for assessing the role of internal variability in future climate based on a simple analytic model and the statistics of the unforced climate variability. The analytic model is derived from the standard error of the regression and assumes that the statistics of the internal variability are roughly Gaussian and stationary in time. When applied to the statistics of an unforced control simulation, the analytic model provides a remarkably robust estimate of the uncertainty in future climate indicated by a large ensemble of climate change simulations. To the extent that observations can be used to estimate the amplitude of internal climate variability, it is argued that the uncertainty in future climate trends due to internal variability can be robustly estimated from the statistics of the observed climate.},

However, the contribution of BC to ongoing changes in global climate is under debate. Anthropogenic BC emissions, and the resulting distribution of BC concentration, are highly uncertain. In particular, long-range transport and processes affecting BC atmospheric lifetime are poorly understood. Here we discuss whether recent assessments may have overestimated present-day BC radiative forcing in remote regions. We compare vertical profiles of BC concentration from four recent aircraft measurement campaigns to simulations by 13 aerosol models participating in the AeroCom Phase II intercomparison. An atmospheric lifetime of BC of less than 5 days is shown to be essential for reproducing observations in remote ocean regions, in line with other recent studies. Adjusting model results to measurements in remote regions, and at high altitudes, leads to a 25\% reduction in AeroCom Phase II median direct BC forcing, from fossil fuel and biofuel burning, over the industrial era. The sensitivity of modelled forcing to BC vertical profile and lifetime highlights an urgent need for further flight campaigns, close to sources and in remote regions, to provide improved quantification of BC effects for use in climate policy.},

	abstract = {We describe the historical evolution of the conceptualization, formulation, quantification, application and utilization of “radiative forcing (RF, see e.g., IPCC, 1990)” of Earth’s climate. Basic theories of shortwave and long wave radiation were developed through the 19th and 20th centuries, and established the analytical framework for defining and quantifying the perturbations to the Earth’s radiative energy balance by natural and anthropogenic influences. The insight that the Earth’s climate could be radiatively forced by changes in carbon dioxide, first introduced in the 19th century, gained empirical support with sustained observations of the atmospheric concentrations of the gas beginning in 1957. Advances in laboratory and field measurements, theory, instrumentation, computational technology, data and analysis of well-mixed greenhouse gases and the global climate system through the 20th Century enabled the development and formalism of RF; this allowed RF to be related to changes in global-mean surface temperature with the aid of increasingly sophisticated models. This in turn led to RF becoming firmly established as a principal concept in climate science by 1990. The linkage with surface temperature has proven to be the most important application of the RF concept, enabling a simple metric to evaluate the relative climate impacts of different agents. The late 1970s and 1980s saw accelerated developments in quantification including the first assessment of the effect of the forcing due to doubling of carbon dioxide on climate (the “Charney” report, National Research Council, 1979). The concept was subsequently extended to a wide variety of agents beyond well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons) to short-lived species such as ozone. The WMO (1986) and IPCC (1990) international assessments began the important sequence of periodic evaluations and quantifications of the forcings by natural (solar irradiance changes and stratospheric aerosols resulting from volcanic eruptions) and a growing set of anthropogenic agents (WMGHGs, ozone, aerosols, land surface changes, contrails). From 1990s to the present, knowledge and scientific confidence in the radiative agents acting on the climate system has proliferated. The conceptual basis of RF has also evolved as both our understanding of the way radiative forcing drives climate change, and the diversity of the forcing mechanisms, have grown. This has led to the current situation where “Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF, e.g., IPCC, 2013)” is regarded as the preferred practical definition of radiative forcing in order to better capture the link between forcing and global-mean surface temperature change. The use of ERF, however, comes with its own attendant issues, including challenges in its diagnosis from climate models, its applications to small forcings, and blurring of the distinction between rapid climate adjustments (fast responses) and climate feedbacks; this will necessitate further elaboration of its utility in the future. Global climate model simulations of radiative perturbations by various agents have established how the forcings affect other climate variables besides temperature e.g., precipitation. The forcing-response linkage as simulated by models, including the diversity in the spatial distribution of forcings by the different agents, has provided a practical demonstration of the effectiveness of agents in perturbing the radiative energy balance and causing climate changes. The significant advances over the past half-century have established, with very high confidence, that the global-mean ERF due to human activity since preindustrial times is positive (the 2013 IPCC assessment gives a best estimate of 2.3 W m-2, with a range from 1.1 to 3.3 W m-2; 90\% confidence interval). Further, except in the immediate aftermath of climatically-significant volcanic eruptions, the net anthropogenic forcing dominates over natural radiative forcing mechanisms. Nevertheless, the substantial remaining uncertainty in the net anthropogenic ERF leads to large uncertainties in estimates of climate sensitivity from observations and in predicting future climate impacts. The uncertainty in the ERF arises principally from the incorporation of the rapid climate adjustments in the formulation, the well-recognized difficulties in characterizing the preindustrial state of the atmosphere, and the incomplete knowledge of the interactions of aerosols with clouds. This uncertainty impairs the quantitative evaluation of climate adaptation and mitigation pathways in the future. A grand challenge in Earth System science lies in continuing to sustain the relatively simple essence of the radiative forcing concept in a form similar to that originally devised, and at the same time improving the quantification of the forcing. This, in turn, demands an accurate, yet increasingly complex and comprehensive, accounting of the relevant processes in the climate system.},

How one can find a candidate for the global minimum of the cost functions in the machine learning context using a method from data assimilation is discussed. Calculations on simple models from each side of the equivalence are reported. Also discussed is a framework in which the time or layer label is taken to be continuous, providing a differential equation, the Euler-Lagrange equation, which shows that the problem being solved is a two point boundary value problem familiar in the discussion of variational methods. The use of continuous layers is denoted "deepest learning". These problems respect a symplectic symmetry in continuous time/layer phase space. Both Lagrangian versions and Hamiltonian versions of these problems are presented. Their well-studied implementation in a discrete time/layer, while respected the symplectic structure, is addressed. The Hamiltonian version provides a direct rationale for back propagation as a solution method for the canonical momentum.},

Results show that top‐down emissions derived in several recent studies exhibit similar uncertainty as bottom‐up inventories in some regions for certain species and even less in the case of Chinese CO emissions. In general, the largest discrepancies are found outside of regions such as the United States, Europe, and Japan where the most accurate and detailed information on emissions is available. In some regions such as China, which has recently undergone dynamical economic growth and changes in air quality regulations, the top‐down estimates better capture recent emission trends than global bottom‐up inventories. These results show the potential of top‐down estimates to complement bottom‐up inventories and to aide in the development of emission scenarios, particularly in regions where global inventories lack the necessary up‐to‐date and accurate information regarding regional activity data and emission factors such as Africa and India. Areas of future work aimed at quantifying and reducing uncertainty are also highlighted. A regional comparison of recent CO and NOx trends in the five SSPs indicate that SSP126, a strong pollution control scenario, best represents the trends from the top‐down and regional bottom‐up inventories in the United States, Europe, and China, while SSP460, a low‐pollution control scenario, lies closest to actual trends in West Africa. This analysis can be useful for air quality forecasting and near‐future pollution control/mitigation policy studies. Top‐down emissions from several recent studies are within the range of bottom‐up inventories and exhibit a similar level of uncertainty for some regions and species In China, the United States, and Europe emission trends in the last decade from SSP126 match most closely actual trends from bottom‐up and top‐down estimates In Western Africa and India recent emission trends from low pollution control scenarios (SSP460 and SSP370, respectively) match most closely actual trends},

The aerosol termination effect simulated by the updated CESM2 simulations of +0.14±0.07 W m−2 and 0.08K±0.03 K is consistent with observations of both radiative forcing and surface temperature, manifesting a similar delay as the one observed in observational datasets between the implementation of the emission changes and the anomalous increase in warming. Our findings highlight the importance of considering realistic near-future changes in short-lived climate forcers for future climate projections, such as for CMIP7, for an improved understanding and communication of short-term climatic changes.},

	abstract = {A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of ozone in climate change simulations, for example concerning global warming projections and atmospheric dynamics. However, fully interactive atmospheric chemistry schemes needed for calculating changes in ozone are computationally expensive. Climate modelers therefore often use climatological ozone fields, which are typically neither consistent with the actual climate state simulated by each model nor with the specific climate change scenario. This limitation applies in particular to standard modeling experiments such as preindustrial control or abrupt 4xCO2 climate sensitivity simulations. Here we suggest a novel method using a simple linear machine learning regression algorithm to predict ozone distributions for preindustrial and abrupt 4xCO2 simulations. Using the atmospheric temperature field as the only input, the regression reliably predicts three-dimensional ozone distributions at monthly to daily time intervals. In particular, the representation of stratospheric ozone variability is much improved compared with a fixed climatology, which is important for interactions with dynamical phenomena such as the polar vortices and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. Our method requires training data covering only a fraction of the usual length of simulations and thus promises to be an important stepping stone towards a range of new computationally efficient methods to consider ozone changes in long climate simulations. We highlight key development steps to further improve and extend the scope of machine learning-based ozone parameterizations.},

However, reasons for this anti‐correlation are less explored. In this study, we perturb the cloud ice microphysical processes to obtain cloud liquid of varying amounts in two Earth System Models (ESMs). We find that the model simulations with a larger liquid water path (LWP) tend to have a stronger cooling from ACI and a stronger positive cloud feedback. More liquid clouds in the mean‐state present more opportunities for anthropogenic aerosol perturbations and also weaken the negative cloud feedback at middle to high latitudes. This work, from a cloud state perspective, emphasizes the influence of the mean‐state LWP on effective radiative forcing due to ACI (ERFACI). Since the preindustrial era, emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols have both increased substantially. Planetary warming from the elevated GHGs causes changes in cloud distribution and properties, thereby imposing feedbacks on the climate system. At the same time, aerosols from air pollution exert a cooling effect by modifying cloud properties and lifetime. Cloud feedback and aerosol‐cloud interactions (ACI) are two critical factors for understanding the past and projecting the future climate change. In this study, we examine the relationships of ACI and cloud feedback with the mean‐state cloud liquid water amount predicted from simulations with two different Earth system models. We find that both the effective radiative forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions (ERFACI) and the cloud feedback are modulated by mean‐state liquid water path (LWP). The warming induced by cloud feedback and cooling by ACI counteracts each other. Our study suggests that the mean‐state LWP is an important factor influencing both ERFACI and the cloud feedback, and is a useful index for the future climate projection. Effective radiative forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions strengthens with the increase of mean‐state LWP in two Earth System Models Cloud radiative feedback increases monotonically with the increase of mean‐state LWP Mean‐state LWP is a good predictor for both ERFACI and cloud radiative feedback Effective radiative forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions strengthens with the increase of mean‐state LWP in two Earth System Models Cloud radiative feedback increases monotonically with the increase of mean‐state LWP Mean‐state LWP is a good predictor for both ERFACI and cloud radiative feedback},

A well-calibrated model can reasonably propagate information from observations to unobserved variables via model physics, but traditional calibration is highly inefficient and results in non-unique solutions. Here we propose a novel differentiable parameter learning (dPL) framework that efficiently learns a global mapping between inputs (and optionally responses) and parameters. Crucially, dPL exhibits beneficial scaling curves not previously demonstrated to geoscientists: as training data increases, dPL achieves better performance, more physical coherence, and better generalizability (across space and uncalibrated variables), all with orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost. We demonstrate examples that learned from soil moisture and streamflow, where dPL drastically outperformed existing evolutionary and regionalization methods, or required only {\textasciitilde}12.5\% of the training data to achieve similar performance. The generic scheme promotes the integration of deep learning and process-based models, without mandating reimplementation. Much effort is invested in calibrating model parameters for accurate outputs, but established methods can be inefficient and generic. By learning from big dataset, a new differentiable framework for model parameterization outperforms state-of-the-art methods, produce more physically-coherent results, using a fraction of the training data, computational power, and time. The method promotes a deep integration of machine learning with process-based geoscientific models.},

	abstract = {It is widely believed on statistical grounds that life has arisen many times all around the universe (Asimov 1979; Billingham 1981). However varied in detail alien forms of life may be, there will probably be certain principles that are fundamental to all life, everywhere. I suggest that prominent among these will be the principles of Darwinism. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is more than a local theory to account for the existence and form of life on Earth. It is probably the only theory that can adequately account for the phenomena that we associate with life. My concern is not with the details of other planets. I shall not speculate about alien biochemistries based on silicon chains, or alien neurophysiologies based on silicon chips. The universal perspective is my way of dramatizing the importance of Darwinism for our own biology here on Earth, and my examples will be mostly taken from Earthly biology. I do, however, also think that “exobiologists” speculating about extraterrestrial life should make more use of evolutionary reasoning. Their writings have been rich in speculation about how extraterrestrial life might work, but poor in discussion about how it might evolve. This essay should, therefore, be seen firstly as an argument for the general importance of Darwin's theory of natural selection; secondly as a preliminary contribution to a new discipline of “evolutionary exobiology.”},

Here we use the linearized radiative kernel-technique in combination with a Gregory analysis to determine the strength and structure of feedbacks, as well as direct and adjusted CO2 forcings in the coupled Max Planck Institute Earth System Model at base resolution (MPI-ESM-LR). We show that the combined Kernel-Gregory approach yields an elegant separation of surface temperature-dependent feedbacks from contributions to radiative forcing by fast adjustments. MPI-ESM-LR exhibits a relatively large cloud adjustment of nearly 2 W m−2 in direct response to quadrupled CO2, with positive cloud adjustment evident throughout the tropics, subtropics and over most landmasses whereas midlatitude storm tracks contribute negatively. The model features a nonlinear regression of radiation imbalance to global mean surface temperature change, resulting in a significantly increasing effective climate sensitivity after about 20 years which is approximately at temperatures 4–5 K above preindustrial. This feature is not uncommon among climate models and is relevant for future climate projections. We analyze the contribution of the individual feedback processes to this behavior and discuss possible origins such as differential ocean warming patterns associated with deep-ocean heat uptake or state dependencies of the feedback processes.},

The population-splitting approximation consists of dividing the population of growing droplets into two categories: those that experience significant growth after exposed to a supersaturation larger than their critical supersaturation, and those that do not grow much larger than their critical diameter. The modifications introduced here lead to an improved accuracy and precision of the parameterization-derived maximum supersaturation, smax, and droplet-number concentration, Nd, as determined by comparing against those of detailed numerical simulations of the activation process. A numerical computation of the first-order derivatives ∂ Nd/∂ χj of the parameterized Nd to input variables χi was performed and compared against the corresponding parcel-model-derived sensitivities, providing a thorough evaluation of the impacts of the introduced modifications in the parameterization ability to respond to aerosol characteristics. An evaluation of the parameterization computation of Nd and smax against detailed numerical simulations of the activation process showed a relative error of −6.0\% ± 6.2\% for smax, and −2.7\% ± 4.8\% for Nd, which represents a considerable reduction in prediction bias when compared to earlier versions of the parameterization. The proposed modifications require only minor changes for their numerical implementation in existing codes based on the population-splitting concept.},

Application of the suggested methodology over a Lagrangian framework that track the clouds as they are advected by the wind and comparison of the results between pairs of consecutive images indicate that the resulted segmentation is robust and consistent.

A quasi‐Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling approach is adopted to effectively explore the high‐dimensional parameter space and a generalized linear model is adopted to study the responses of simulated cloud fields to tunable parameters. One stratocumulus and two shallow cumulus cases are configured at both coarse and fine vertical resolutions in this study. Our results show that most of the variance in simulated cloud fields can be explained by a small number of tunable parameters. The parameters related to Newtonian and buoyancy‐damping terms of total water flux are found to be the most influential parameters for stratocumulus. For shallow cumulus, the most influential parameters are those related to skewness of vertical velocity, reflecting the strong coupling between cloud properties and dynamics in this regime. The influential parameters in the stratocumulus case are sensitive to the vertical resolution while little sensitivity is found for the shallow cumulus cases, as eddy mixing length (or dissipation time scale) plays a more important role and depends more strongly on the vertical resolution in stratocumulus than in shallow convections. The influential parameters remain almost unchanged when the number of tunable parameters increases from 16 to 35. This study improves understanding of the CLUBB behavior associated with parameter uncertainties and provides valuable insights for other high‐order turbulence closure schemes.

	abstract = {Earth observation from satellite sensory data poses challenging problems, where machine learning is currently a key player. In recent years, Gaussian Process (GP) regression have excelled in biophysical parameter estimation tasks from airborne and satellite observations. GP regression is based on solid Bayesian statistics, and generally yields efficient and accurate parameter estimates. However, GPs are typically used for inverse modeling based on concurrent observations and in situ measurements only. Very often a forward model encoding the well-understood physical relations between the state vector and the radiance observations is available though and could be useful to improve predictions and understanding. In this work, we review three GP models that respect and learn the physics of the underlying processes in the context of both forward and inverse modeling. After reviewing the traditional application of GPs for parameter retrieval, we introduce a Joint GP (JGP) model that combines in situ measurements and simulated data in a single GP model. Then, we present a latent force model (LFM) for GP modeling that encodes ordinary differential equations to blend data-driven modeling and physical constraints of the system governing equations. The LFM performs multi-output regression, adapts to the signal characteristics, is able to cope with missing data in the time series, and provides explicit latent functions that allow system analysis and evaluation. Finally, we present an Automatic Gaussian Process Emulator (AGAPE) that approximates the forward physical model using concepts from Bayesian optimization and at the same time builds an optimally compact look-up-table for inversion. We give empirical evidence of the performance of these models through illustrative examples of vegetation monitoring and atmospheric modeling.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols and their impact on cloud properties remain the largest uncertainty in the human forcing of the climate system. By increasing the concentration of cloud droplets (Nd), aerosols reduce droplet size and increase the reflectivity of clouds (a negative radiative forcing). Central to this climate impact is the susceptibility of cloud droplet number to aerosol (β), the diversity of which explains much of the variation in radiative forcing in global climate models. This has made measuring β a key target for developing observational constraints of the aerosol forcing. While the aerosol burden of the clean, pre-industrial atmosphere has been demonstrated as a key uncertainty for the aerosol forcing, here we show that the behaviour of clouds under these clean conditions is of equal importance for understanding the spread in radiative forcing estimates between models and observations. This means that the uncertainty in the aerosol impact on clouds is, counterintuitively, driven by situations with little aerosol. Discarding clean conditions produces a close agreement between different model and observational estimates of the cloud response to aerosol, but does not provide a strong constraint on the radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions. This makes constraining aerosol behaviour in clean conditions a key goal for future observational studies.},

The data set was used to assess cloud droplet closure using (1) a detailed adiabatic cloud parcel model and (2) a state‐of‐the‐art cloud droplet activation parameterization. A unique feature of the data set is the sampling of highly polluted clouds within the vicinity of power plant plumes. Remarkable closure was achieved (much less than the 20\% measurement uncertainty) for both parcel model and parameterization. The highly variable aerosol did not complicate the cloud droplet closure, since the clouds had low maximum supersaturation and were not sensitive to aerosol variations (which took place at small particle sizes). The error in predicted cloud droplet concentration was mostly sensitive to updraft velocity. Optimal closure is obtained if the water vapor uptake coefficient is equal to 0.06, but can range between 0.03 and 1.0. The sensitivity of cloud droplet prediction error to changes in the uptake coefficient, organic solubility and surface tension depression suggest that organics exhibit limited solubility. These findings can serve as much needed constraints in modeling of aerosol‐cloud interactions in the North America; future in situ studies will determine the robustness of our findings.},

It is based on the assumption that changes in MSC cloud regimes that occur at short distance in homogeneous meteorological conditions are related to respective changes in the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The method was applied to 50 cases of well defined transitions from closed to open cells. It was found that the negative cloud radiative effect (CRE) over the closed cells is on average higher by 109±18Wm−2 than that over the adjacent open cells. This large negative CRE is composed of the cloud cover (42±8\%), LWP (32±8\%) and Twomey (26±6\%) effects. This shows that the Twomey effect, which is caused by change in droplet concentration for a given LWP, contributes only a quarter of the difference in CRE, whereas the rest is contributed by added cloud water to the open cells both in the horizontal (cloud cover effect) and in the vertical (LWP effect) dimensions. The results suggest the possibility that anthropogenic aerosols that affect MSC-regime-changes might incur large negative radiative forcing on the global scale, mainly due to the cloud cover effect.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosol forcing is spatially heterogeneous, mostly localised around industrialised regions like North America, Europe, East and South Asia. Emission reductions in each of these regions will force the climate in different locations, which could have diverse impacts on regional and global climate. Here, we show that removing sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from any of these northern-hemisphere regions in a global composition-climate model results in significant warming across the hemisphere, regardless of the emission region. Although the temperature response to these regionally localised forcings varies considerably in magnitude depending on the emission region, it shows a preferred spatial pattern independent of the location of the forcing. Using empirical orthogonal function analysis, we show that the structure of the response is tied to existing modes of internal climate variability in the model. This has implications for assessing impacts of emission reduction policies, and our understanding of how climate responds to heterogeneous forcings. Aerosol pollution from different industrialised regions produces similar, hemisphere-wide effects on climate. Matthew Kasoar and colleagues from Imperial College London, UK, used a state-of-the-art climate model to look at how sulphate aerosol pollution affects the global climate, depending on whether the pollution is emitted from North America, Europe, South Asia, or East Asia. Simulations showed that although the pollution scatters incoming sunlight mainly around the emission region, the effect this has on temperatures extends around the world, with a consistent pattern of temperature changes which were particularly strong over the Arctic, North America, and Western Siberia. However, some regions, like the US and Europe, were more able to produce large temperature changes for a given emission change. This information could be used to estimate global impacts of different air pollution mitigation strategies.},

Using numerical simulations, it was estimated that the time needed for such cloud fields to approach this state is {\textgreater}24 hr. These results suggest that the typical cloud field lifetime is an important parameter in determining the total aerosol effect. Here, analyzing satellite observations and reanalysis data (with the aid of numerical simulations), we show that the characteristic timescale of warm convective cloud fields is less than 12 hr. Such a timescale implies that these clouds should be regarded as transient-state phenomena and therefore can be highly susceptible to changes in aerosol properties.},

	abstract = {The effective radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols (ERFaer) is an important measure of the anthropogenic aerosol effects simulated by a global climate model. Here we analyze ERFaer simulated by the E3SM version 1 (E3SMv1) atmospheric model using both century-long free-running atmosphere–land simulations and short nudged simulations. We relate the simulated ERFaer to characteristics of the aerosol composition and optical properties, and we evaluate the relationships between key aerosol and cloud properties. In terms of historical changes from the year 1870 to 2014, our results show that the global mean anthropogenic aerosol burden and optical depth increase during the simulation period as expected, but the regional averages show large differences in the temporal evolution. The largest regional differences are found in the emission-induced evolution of the burden and optical depth of the sulfate aerosol: a strong decreasing trend is seen in the Northern Hemisphere high-latitude region after around 1970, while a continued increase is simulated in the tropics. The relationships between key aerosol and cloud properties (relative changes between pre-industrial and present-day conditions) also show evident changes after 1970, diverging from the linear relationships exhibited for the period of 1870–1969. In addition to the regional differences in the simulated relationships, a reduced sensitivity in cloud droplet number and other cloud properties to aerosol perturbations is seen when the aerosol perturbation is large. Consequently, the global annual mean ERFaer magnitude does not increase after around 1970. The ERFaer in E3SMv1 is relatively large compared to the recently published multi-model estimates; the primary reason is the large indirect aerosol effect (i.e., through aerosol–cloud interactions). Compared to other models, E3SMv1 features large relative changes in the cloud droplet effective radius in response to aerosol perturbations. Large sensitivity is also seen in the liquid cloud optical depth, which is determined by changes in both the effective radius and liquid water path. Aerosol-induced changes in liquid and ice cloud properties in E3SMv1 are found to have a strong correlation, as the evolution of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols affects both the liquid cloud formation and the homogeneous ice nucleation in cirrus clouds (that causes a large effect on longwave ERFaer). As suggested by a previous study, the large ERFaer appears to be one of the reasons why the model cannot reproduce the observed global mean temperature evolution in the second half of the 20th century. Sensitivity simulations are performed to understand which parameterization and/or parameter changes have a large impact on the simulated ERFaer. The ERFaer estimates in E3SMv1 for the shortwave and longwave components are sensitive to the parameterization changes in both liquid and ice cloud processes. When the parameterization of ice cloud processes is modified, the top-of-model forcing changes in the shortwave and longwave components largely offset each other, so the net effect is negligible. This suggests that, to reduce the magnitude of the net ERFaer, it would be more effective to reduce the anthropogenic aerosol effect through liquid or mixed-phase clouds.},

This approach represents a significant departure from traditional microphysics schemes in which ice-phase hydrometeors are partitioned into various predefined categories (e.g., cloud ice, snow, and graupel) with prescribed characteristics. The liquid-phase component of the new scheme uses a standard two-moment, two-category approach. The proposed method and a complete description of the new predicted particle properties (P3) scheme are provided. Results from idealized model simulations of a two-dimensional squall line are presented that illustrate overall behavior of the scheme. Despite its use of a single ice-phase category, the scheme simulates a realistically wide range of particle characteristics in different regions of the squall line, consistent with observed ice particles in real squall lines. Sensitivity tests show that both the prediction of the rime mass fraction and the rime density are important for the simulation of the squall-line structure and precipitation.},

A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy.

Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example.

In nonprecipitating simulations, the increased surface latent heat flux in the warmer climate produces a deeper and drier cloud layer with reduced cloud fractions between 1.5 and 4 km. Precipitation prevents the deepening and drying of the cloud layer in response to warming. Cloud fractions still decrease in the upper cloud layer, because stratiform outflow layers near cloud tops are less pronounced and because the larger liquid water contents are confined to narrower updrafts. Simulations on a 16‐fold larger domain lead to the spatial organization of clouds into larger and deeper cloud clusters. The presence of deeper clouds results in a shallower, warmer, and drier trade‐wind layer, with strongly reduced cloud cover. The warming response in the precipitating large‐domain simulation nevertheless remains similar to the small‐domain precipitating simulation. On the large domain, deeper clouds can also develop without precipitation, because moisture‐convection feedbacks strengthen in the absence of cold‐pool dynamics. Overall, total cloud cover and albedo decrease only slightly with warming in all cases. This demonstrates the robustness of shallow cumuli—in particular of cloud fraction near the lifting condensation level—to changes in the large‐scale environment.

Long term exposure estimates of this type can be made using spatially distributed air quality and population density data. Gridded chemical transport models (CTMs) are often used for this purpose, however the grid resolution of CTMs that cover entire continents is usually limited to 25–100 km and there may be a significant level of unresolved variability within the grids that will impact on the exposure estimates. In this paper sub-grid variability and its impact on long term exposure estimates is assessed by investigating the covariance of concentration and population, which is shown to be the defining term in estimating the average sub-grid population exposure. A parameterisation of the sub-grid covariance is described, based on the sub-grid covariance of other proxy data, and this is applied using EMEP model results for all of Europe. The study shows that the error made in the exposure calculations for all of Europe is significant for the typical CTM resolution of 50 km. The error is largest for NO2, where the average European urban background exposure using CTMs is underestimated by 44 ± 4\%. Particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) is also underestimated, but only by 15 ± 4\%. Calculation of the sub-grid covariance for the ozone health indicator SOMO35 (Sum of Ozone 8 h running Means Over 35 ppb) was not carried out for all of Europe as the sub-grid parameterisation was considered too uncertain for useful application. However, estimates based on observations alone show that population weighted SOMO35 concentrations are overestimated by around 13\% when using model grid resolutions of 50 km.},

Due to their short tropospheric lifetime of only several days, the aerosol forcing responds quickly to emissions. Here, we present and discuss the evolution of the aerosol forcing since 2000. There are multiple lines of evidence that allow us to robustly conclude that the anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) – both aerosol–radiation interactions (ERFari) and aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) – has become less negative globally, i.e. the trend in aerosol effective radiative forcing changed sign from negative to positive. Bottom-up inventories show that anthropogenic primary aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions declined in most regions of the world; observations related to aerosol burden show declining trends, in particular of the fine-mode particles that make up most of the anthropogenic aerosols; satellite retrievals of cloud droplet numbers show trends in regions with aerosol declines that are consistent with these in sign, as do observations of top-of-atmosphere radiation. Climate model results, including a revised set that is constrained by observations of the ocean heat content evolution show a consistent sign and magnitude for a positive forcing relative to the year 2000 due to reduced aerosol effects. This reduction leads to an acceleration of the forcing of climate change, i.e. an increase in forcing by 0.1 to 0.3 W m-2, up to 12 \% of the total climate forcing in 2019 compared to 1750 according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).},

An uncertainty analysis of such a computer model known as Galform is presented. Galform models the creation and evolution of approximately one million galaxies from the beginning of the Universe until the current day, and is regarded as a state-of-the-art model within the cosmology community. It requires the specification of many input parameters in order to run the simulation, takes significant time to run, and provides various outputs that can be compared with real world data. A Bayes Linear approach is presented in order to identify the subset of the input space that could give rise to acceptable matches between model output and measured data. This approach takes account of the major sources of uncertainty in a consistent and unified manner, including input parameter uncertainty, function uncertainty, observational error, forcing function uncertainty and structural uncertainty. The approach is known as History Matching, and involves the use of an iterative succession of emulators (stochastic belief specifications detailing beliefs about the Galform function), which are used to cut down the input parameter space. The analysis was successful in producing a large collection of model evaluations that exhibit good fits to the observed data.},

	abstract = {The atmospheric Green's function method is a technique for modeling the response of the atmosphere to changes in the spatial field of surface temperature. While early studies applied this method to changes in atmospheric circulation, it has also become an important tool to understand changes in radiative feedbacks due to evolving patterns of warming, a phenomenon called the “pattern effect.” To better study this method, this paper presents a protocol for creating atmospheric Green's functions to serve as the basis for a model intercomparison project, GFMIP. The protocol has been developed using a series of sensitivity tests performed with the HadAM3 atmosphere‐only general circulation model, along with existing and new simulations from other models. Our preliminary results have uncovered nonlinearities in the response of the atmosphere to surface temperature changes, including an asymmetrical response to warming versus cooling patch perturbations, and a change in the dependence of the response on the magnitude and size of the patches. These nonlinearities suggest that the pattern effect may depend on the heterogeneity of warming as well as its location. These experiments have also revealed tradeoffs in experimental design between patch size, perturbation strength, and the length of control and patch simulations. The protocol chosen on the basis of these experiments balances scientific utility with the simulation time and setup required by the Green's function approach. Running these simulations will further our understanding of many aspects of atmospheric response, from the pattern effect and radiative feedbacks to changes in circulation, cloudiness, and precipitation. Many properties of the atmosphere are affected by the temperature of the ocean surface. Knowing how strong these effects are would help us to better predict global warming. The response to a given surface warming depends on where the warming occurs. To account for this, researchers sometimes simulate the response to individual patches of warming and then assume the response to an arbitrary warming pattern can be summed together from these patch responses. This is sometimes called the atmospheric Green's function method, and it works well at recreating the atmospheric response to historical temperature changes. We are organizing a Green's Function Model Intercomparison Project (GFMIP), in which participants will apply the method consistently for many climate models. This paper presents the GFMIP protocol. In the course of developing this protocol, we found that the atmospheric response to warming is not proportional in all cases: the response to surface warming is not the opposite of the response to surface cooling; warming twice as much doesn't cause twice as much of a response; and making a patch of warming twice as large doesn't cause twice as large a response. GFMIP will help us figure out how to account for this nonlinearity. The Green's Function Model Intercomparison Project (GFMIP) explores the atmospheric response to surface temperature patch perturbations This paper presents the GFMIP protocol, which was generated using insights from past studies and new sensitivity tests Green's functions reconstruct the response to historical temperatures, but nonlinearities can affect responses to other warming patterns The Green's Function Model Intercomparison Project (GFMIP) explores the atmospheric response to surface temperature patch perturbations This paper presents the GFMIP protocol, which was generated using insights from past studies and new sensitivity tests Green's functions reconstruct the response to historical temperatures, but nonlinearities can affect responses to other warming patterns},

Traditionally, additivity is assumed in the assessment of the aerosol climate impact, as the underlying bulk aerosol models are largely constrained to linearity. The microphysical aerosol module HAM establishes degrees of freedom for nonlinear responses of the aerosol system. In this study’s results, aerosol column mass burdens respond nonlinearly to changes in anthropogenic emissions, manifested in alterations of the aerosol lifetimes. Specific emission changes induce modifications of aerosol cycles with unaltered emissions, indicating a microphysical coupling of the aerosol cycles. Anthropogenic carbonaceous emissions disproportionately contribute to the accumulation mode numbers close to the source regions. In contrast, anthropogenic sulfuric emissions less than proportionally contribute to the accumulation mode numbers close to the source regions and disproportionately contribute in remote regions. The additivity of the aerosol system is analyzed by comparing the changes from a simulation with emission changes for several compounds with the sum of changes of single simulations, in each of which one of the emission changes was introduced. Close to the anthropogenic source regions, deviations from additivity are found at up to 30\% and 15\% for the accumulation mode number burden and aerosol optical thickness, respectively. These results challenge the traditional approach of assessing the climate impact of aerosols separately for each component and demand for integrated assessments and emission strategies.},

	abstract = {Rapid adjustments are responses to forcing agents that cause a perturbation to the top of atmosphere energy budget but are uncoupled to changes in surface warming. Different mechanisms are responsible for these adjustments for a variety of climate drivers. These remain to be quantified in detail. It is shown that rapid adjustments reduce the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of black carbon by half of the instantaneous forcing, but for CO2 forcing, rapid adjustments increase ERF. Competing tropospheric adjustments for CO2 forcing are individually significant but sum to zero, such that the ERF equals the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing, but this is not true for other forcing agents. Additional experiments of increase in the solar constant and increase in CH4 are used to show that a key factor of the rapid adjustment for an individual climate driver is changes in temperature in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Long‐term global warming can be estimated with knowledge of how climate forcing agents affect the Earth's top‐of‐atmosphere energy imbalance or effective radiative forcing. Changes in climate forcers, such as greenhouse gases, the Sun's intensity, or emission of aerosol particles, typically impose a direct change in the energy budget, termed an instantaneous radiative forcing. Further to this, a climate forcer may induce changes in the atmosphere, such as a change in thermal structure, clouds, or humidity. These changes themselves, termed rapid adjustments, contribute to the top‐of‐atmosphere energy budget. Together, the instantaneous radiative forcing plus rapid adjustments equals the effective radiative forcing. We show that for different climate forcing agents, the rapid adjustments behave very differently and are driven by different atmospheric mechanisms. For example, rapid adjustments add to the instantaneous forcing for a carbon dioxide increase, due to a cooling of the stratosphere, but oppose instantaneous forcing for black carbon, driven by a warming troposphere and lowering of cloud height. Understanding rapid adjustments gives a more complete picture of the climate effects of different climate forcers. Rapid adjustments affect the Earth's energy balance in different ways for greenhouse gas, aerosol, and solar forcing Radiative kernels and partial radiative perturbations are used to diagnose rapid adjustments from atmospheric and cloud changes Noncloud adjustments agree well between models, whereas cloud adjustments exhibit more spread},

	abstract = {We document the development of the first version of the U.K. Earth System Model UKESM1. The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2‐ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include a new core physical model with a well‐resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric‐stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide; two‐moment, five‐species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two‐way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land, and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall, the model performs well, with a stable pre‐industrial state and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger‐than‐observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealized simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is 5.4 K, transient climate response ranges from 2.68 to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions is 2.49 to 2.66 K TtC−1. We describe the development and behavior of UKESM1, a novel climate model that includes improved representations of processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and on land. These processes are inter‐related: For example, dust is produced on the land and blown up into the atmosphere where it affects the amount of sunlight falling on Earth. Dust can also be dissolved in the ocean, where it affects marine life. This in turn changes both the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean and the material emitted from the surface into the atmosphere, which has an affect on the formation of clouds. UKESM1 includes many processes and interactions such as these, giving it a high level of complexity. Ensuring realistic process behavior is a major challenge in the development of our model, and we have carefully tested this. UKESM1 performs well, correctly exhibiting stable results from a continuous pre‐industrial simulation (used to provide a reference for future experiments) and showing good agreement with observations toward the end of its historical simulations. Results for some properties—including the degree to which average surface temperature changes with increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—are examined in detail. UKESM1 represents a major advance over its predecessor HadGEM2‐ES, both in the complexity of its components and its internal coupling The complex coupling presents challenges to the model development; we document the tuning process employed to obtain acceptable performance UKESM1 performs well, having a stable pre‐industrial state and showing good agreement with observations in a wide variety of contexts},

	abstract = {Abstract. Current scientific knowledge on the future response of the climate system to human-induced perturbations is comprehensively captured by various model intercomparison efforts. In the preparation of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), intercomparisons were organized for atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and carbon cycle models, named "CMIP3" and "C4MIP", respectively. Despite their tremendous value for the scientific community and policy makers alike, there are some difficulties in interpreting the results. For example, radiative forcings were not standardized across the various AOGCM integrations and carbon cycle runs, and, in some models, key forcings were omitted. Furthermore, the AOGCM analysis of plausible emissions pathways was restricted to only three SRES scenarios. This study attempts to address these issues. We present an updated version of MAGICC, the simple carbon cycle-climate model used in past IPCC Assessment Reports with enhanced representation of time-varying climate sensitivities, carbon cycle feedbacks, aerosol forcings and ocean heat uptake characteristics. This new version, MAGICC6, is successfully calibrated against the higher complexity AOGCMs and carbon cycle models. Parameterizations of MAGICC6 are provided. The mean of the emulations presented here using MAGICC6 deviates from the mean AOGCM responses by only 2.2\% on average for the SRES scenarios. This enhanced emulation skill in comparison to previous calibrations is primarily due to: making a "like-with-like comparison" using AOGCM-specific subsets of forcings; employing a new calibration procedure; as well as the fact that the updated simple climate model can now successfully emulate some of the climate-state dependent effective climate sensitivities of AOGCMs. The diagnosed effective climate sensitivity at the time of CO2 doubling for the AOGCMs is on average 2.88 °C, about 0.33 °C cooler than the mean of the reported slab ocean climate sensitivities. In the companion paper (Part 2) of this study, we examine the combined climate system and carbon cycle emulations for the complete range of IPCC SRES emissions scenarios and the new RCP pathways.},

The emulator is constructed using a sensitivity analysis approach (polynomial chaos expansion) which reproduces the behavior of the targeted parcel model across the full range of aerosol properties and meteorology simulated by the parent climate model. An iterative technique using aerosol fields sampled from a global model is used to identify the critical aerosol size distribution parameters necessary for accurately predicting activation. Across the large parameter space used to train them, the emulators estimate cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) with a mean relative error of 9.2 \% for aerosol populations without giant cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and 6.9 \% when including them. Versus a parcel model driven by those same aerosol fields, the best-performing emulator has a mean relative error of 4.6 \%, which is comparable with two commonly used activation schemes also evaluated here (which have mean relative errors of 2.9 and 6.7 \%, respectively). We identify the potential for regional biases in modeled CDNC, particularly in oceanic regimes, where our best-performing emulator tends to overpredict by 7 \%, whereas the reference activation schemes range in mean relative error from -3 to 7 \%. The emulators which include the effects of giant CCN are more accurate in continental regimes (mean relative error of 0.3 \%) but strongly overestimate CDNC in oceanic regimes by up to 22 \%, particularly in the Southern Ocean. The biases in CDNC resulting from the subjective choice of activation scheme could potentially influence the magnitude of the indirect effect diagnosed from the model incorporating it.},

Satellite observations provide frequent, global aerosol-amount maps, but offer only loose aerosol property constraints needed for climate and air quality applications. We define and illustrate the feasibility of flying an aircraft payload to measure key aerosol optical, microphysical, and chemical properties in situ. The flight program could characterize major aerosol air-mass types statistically, at a level-of-detail unobtainable from space. It would: (1) enhance satellite aerosol retrieval products with better climatology assumptions, and (2) improve translation between satellite-retrieved optical properties and species-specific aerosol mass and size simulated in climate models to assess aerosol forcing, its anthropogenic components, and other environmental impacts. As such, Systematic Aircraft Measurements to Characterize Aerosol Air Masses (SAM-CAAM) could add value to data records representing several decades of aerosol observations from space, improve aerosol constraints on climate modeling, help interrelate remote-sensing, in situ, and modeling aerosol-type definitions, and contribute to future satellite aerosol missions. Fifteen Required Variables are identified, and four Payload Options of increasing ambition are defined, to constrain these quantities. "Option C" could meet all the SAM-CAAM objectives with about 20 instruments, most of which have flown before, but never routinely several times per week, and never as a group. Aircraft integration, and approaches to data handling, payload support, and logistical considerations for a long-term, operational mission are discussed. SAM-CAAM is feasible because, for most aerosol sources and specified seasons, particle properties tend to be repeatable, even if aerosol loading varies.},

Such changes are broadly consistent with theoretical understanding, and climate model simulations, of how the planet is expected to respond. This paper reviews this evidence from a regional perspective to reflect a growing interest in understanding the regional effects of climate change, which can differ markedly across the globe. We set out the methodological basis for detection and attribution and discuss the spatial scales on which it is possible to make robust attribution statements. We review the evidence showing significant human-induced changes in regional temperatures, and for the effects of external forcings on changes in the hydrological cycle, the cryosphere, circulation changes, oceanic changes, and changes in extremes. We then discuss future challenges for the science of attribution. To better assess the pace of change, and to understand more about the regional changes to which societies need to adapt, we will need to refine our understanding of the effects of external forcing and internal variability.

	abstract = {To improve our understanding of the impact of sea salt aerosols (SSA) on the Earth's climate, it is critical to understand the physical mechanisms which determine the size‐resolved SSA production flux. Of the factors affecting SSA emissions, seawater salinity has perhaps received the least attention in the literature and previous studies have produced conflicting results. Here, we present a series of laboratory experiments designed to investigate the role of salinity on aerosol production from artificial seawater using a continuous plunging jet. During these experiments, the aerosol and surface bubble size distributions were monitored while the salinity was decreased from 35 to 0 g kg−1. Three distinct salinity regimes were identified: (a) A high salinity regime, 10–35 g kg−1, where lower salinity resulted in only minor reductions in particle number flux but notable reductions in particle volume flux; (b) an intermediate salinity regime, 5–10 g kg−1, with a local maximum in particle number flux; (c) a low salinity regime, {\textless}5 g kg−1, characterized by a rapid decrease in particle number flux at lower salinities and dominated by small particles and larger bubbles. We discuss the implications of our results through comparison of the size‐resolved aerosol flux and the surface bubble population at different salinities. Finally, by varying the seawater temperature at three specific salinities we have also developed a simple parameterization of the particle production flux as a function of seawater temperature and salinity. The range of seawater salinity and temperature studied is representative of the global oceans and lower salinity water bodies such as the Baltic Sea. Sea salt aerosol concentration and size distributions in the head space of the chamber depended on the seawater salinity and temperature Sea salt particle production was linearly dependent on salinity between 10 and 35 g kg−1 and below 5 g kg−1 and peaked between 5 and 10 g kg−1 Temperature affected the sea salt particle number flux with the same sign at all salinities, but the magnitude differed with salinity Sea salt aerosol concentration and size distributions in the head space of the chamber depended on the seawater salinity and temperature Sea salt particle production was linearly dependent on salinity between 10 and 35 g kg−1 and below 5 g kg−1 and peaked between 5 and 10 g kg−1 Temperature affected the sea salt particle number flux with the same sign at all salinities, but the magnitude differed with salinity},

	abstract = {The vertical profile of aerosol is important for its radiative effects, but weakly constrained by observations on the global scale, and highly variable among different models. To investigate the controlling factors in one particular model, we investigate the effects of individual processes in HadGEM3–UKCA and compare the resulting diversity of aerosol vertical profiles with the inter-model diversity from the AeroCom Phase II control experiment. In this way we show that (in this model at least) the vertical profile is controlled by a relatively small number of processes, although these vary among aerosol components and particle sizes. We also show that sufficiently coarse variations in these processes can produce a similar diversity to that among different models in terms of the global-mean profile and, to a lesser extent, the zonal-mean vertical position. However, there are features of certain models' profiles that cannot be reproduced, suggesting the influence of further structural differences between models. In HadGEM3–UKCA, convective transport is found to be very important in controlling the vertical profile of all aerosol components by mass. In-cloud scavenging is very important for all except mineral dust. Growth by condensation is important for sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol (along with aqueous oxidation for the former and ageing by soluble material for the latter). The vertical extent of biomass-burning emissions into the free troposphere is also important for the profile of carbonaceous aerosol. Boundary-layer mixing plays a dominant role for sea salt and mineral dust, which are emitted only from the surface. Dry deposition and below-cloud scavenging are important for the profile of mineral dust only. In this model, the microphysical processes of nucleation, condensation and coagulation dominate the vertical profile of the smallest particles by number (e.g. total CN  {\textgreater}  3 nm), while the profiles of larger particles (e.g. CN  {\textgreater}  100 nm) are controlled by the same processes as the component mass profiles, plus the size distribution of primary emissions. We also show that the processes that affect the AOD-normalised radiative forcing in the model are predominantly those that affect the vertical mass distribution, in particular convective transport, in-cloud scavenging, aqueous oxidation, ageing and the vertical extent of biomass-burning emissions.},

The idealized transfer function for the RDMA differs from that of the conventional cylindrical DMA only by a group of geometrical constants. The RDMA is designed specifically for the measurement of ultrafine aerosol particles, achieving a transmission efficiency of 0.85 to 0.90 in the 3–10-nm size range and having a short residence time to limit diffusional broadening of the transfer function. The simple design of the RDMA reduces the number of precision parts that must be fabricated below that for cylindrical DMAs, resulting in a compact, relatively lightweight, and low-cost instrument.},

However, deep neural networks with the softmax classifier are known to produce highly overconfident posterior distributions even for such abnormal samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for detecting any abnormal samples, which is applicable to any pre-trained softmax neural classifier. We obtain the class conditional Gaussian distributions with respect to (low- and upper-level) features of the deep models under Gaussian discriminant analysis, which result in a confidence score based on the Mahalanobis distance. While most prior methods have been evaluated for detecting either out-of-distribution or adversarial samples, but not both, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances for both cases in our experiments. Moreover, we found that our proposed method is more robust in harsh cases, e.g., when the training dataset has noisy labels or small number of samples. Finally, we show that the proposed method enjoys broader usage by applying it to class-incremental learning: whenever out-of-distribution samples are detected, our classification rule can incorporate new classes well without further training deep models.},

This implies a geophysical commitment to temporarily crossing warming levels before reaching them. Here we use an emissions-based climate model (FaIR) to estimate temperature change following cessation of emissions in 2021 and in every year thereafter until 2080 following eight Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Assuming a medium-emissions trajectory (SSP2–4.5), we find that we are already committed to peak warming greater than 1.5 °C with 42\% probability, increasing to 66\% by 2029 (340 GtCO2 relative to 2021). Probability of peak warming greater than 2.0 °C is currently 2\%, increasing to 66\% by 2057 (1,550 GtCO2 relative to 2021). Because climate will cool from peak warming as GHG concentrations decline, committed warming of 1.5 °C in 2100 will not occur with at least 66\% probability until 2055. Halting emissions does not immediately stop warming as atmospheric concentrations continue to warm the planet. This study shows society may already be committed to exceeding 1.5 °C peak warming with 42\% probability; delaying cuts increases this to 66\% in 2029 for all scenarios.},

The glaciation effect can partly offset the indirect aerosol effect on warm clouds and thus causes the total anthropogenic aerosol effect to be smaller. It is investigated by varying the parameterization for the Bergeron-Findeisen process and the threshold coating thickness of sulfate (SO4-crit), which is required to convert an externally mixed aerosol particle into an internally mixed particle. Differences in the net radiation at the top-of-the-atmosphere due to anthropogenic aerosols between the different sensitivity studies amount up to 0.5 W m−2. This suggests that the investigated mixed-phase processes have a major effect on the total anthropogenic aerosol effect.},

This real-time instrument is field-deployable, and its high time resolution (0.5 Hz has been demonstrated) makes it well-suited for studies in which time resolution is critical, such as aircraft studies. The instrument has two ion optical modes: a single-reflection configuration offers higher sensitivity and lower resolving power (up to ∼2100 at m/z 200), and a two-reflectron configuration yields higher resolving power (up to ∼4300 at m/z 200) with lower sensitivity. The instrument also allows the determination of the size distributions of all ions. One-minute detection limits for submicrometer aerosol are {\textless}0.04 μg m-3 for all species in the high-sensitivity mode and {\textless}0.4 μg m-3 in the high-resolution mode. Examples of ambient aerosol data are presented from the SOAR-1 study in Riverside, CA, in which the spectra of ambient organic species are dominated by CxHy and CxHyOz fragments, and different organic and inorganic fragments at the same nominal m/z show different size distributions.

	abstract = {We use simple pattern scaling and time-shift to emulate changes in a set of climate extreme indices under future scenarios, and we evaluate the emulators accuracy. We propose an error metric that separates systematic emulation errors from discrepancies between emulated and target values due to internal variability, taking advantage of the availability of climate model simulations in the form of initial condition ensembles. We compute the error metric at grid-point scale, and we show geographically resolved results, or aggregate them as global averages. We use a range of scenarios spanning global temperature increases by the end of the century of 1.5 C and 2.0 C compared to a pre-industrial baseline, and two higher trajectories, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. With this suite of scenarios we can test the effects on the error of the size of the temperature gap between emulation origin and target scenarios. We find that in the emulation of most indices the dominant source of discrepancy is internal variability. For at least one index, however, counting exceedances of a high temperature threshold, significant portions of the globally aggregated discrepancy and its regional pattern originate from the systematic emulation error. The metric also highlights a fundamental difference in the two methods related to the simulation of internal variability, which is significantly resized by simple pattern scaling. This aspect needs to be considered when using these methods in applications where preserving variability for uncertainty quantification is important. We propose our metric as a diagnostic tool, facilitating the formulation of scientific hypotheses on the reasons for the error. In the meantime, we show that for many impact relevant indices these two well established emulation techniques perform accurately when measured against internal variability, establishing the fundamental condition for using them to represent climate drivers in impact modeling.},

	abstract = {The activation of aerosols to form cloud droplets is dependent upon vertical velocities whose local variability is not typically resolved at the GCM grid scale. Consequently, it is necessary to represent the subgrid-scale variability of vertical velocity in the calculation of cloud droplet number concentration. This study uses the UK Chemistry and Aerosols community model (UKCA) within the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model (HadGEM3), coupled for the first time to an explicit aerosol activation parameterisation, and hence known as UKCA-Activate. We explore the range of uncertainty in estimates of the indirect aerosol effects attributable to the choice of parameterisation of the subgrid-scale variability of vertical velocity in HadGEM-UKCA. Results of simulations demonstrate that the use of a characteristic vertical velocity cannot replicate results derived with a distribution of vertical velocities, and is to be discouraged in GCMs. This study focuses on the effect of the variance (σw2) of a Gaussian pdf (probability density function) of vertical velocity. Fixed values of σw (spanning the range measured in situ by nine flight campaigns found in the literature) and a configuration in which σw depends on turbulent kinetic energy are tested. Results from the mid-range fixed σw and TKE-based configurations both compare well with observed vertical velocity distributions and cloud droplet number concentrations. The radiative flux perturbation due to the total effects of anthropogenic aerosol is estimated at −1.9 W m−2 with σw = 0.1 m s−1, −2.1 W m−2 with σw derived from TKE, −2.25 W m−2 with σw = 0.4 m s−1, and −2.3 W m−2 with σw = 0.7 m s−1. The breadth of this range is 0.4 W m−2, which is comparable to a substantial fraction of the total diversity of current aerosol forcing estimates. Reducing the uncertainty in the parameterisation of σw would therefore be an important step towards reducing the uncertainty in estimates of the indirect aerosol effects. Detailed examination of regional radiative flux perturbations reveals that aerosol microphysics can be responsible for some climate-relevant radiative effects, highlighting the importance of including microphysical aerosol processes in GCMs.},

	abstract = {We use a global climate model to compare the effectiveness of many climate forcing agents for producing climate change. We find a substantial range in the “efficacy” of different forcings, where the efficacy is the global temperature response per unit forcing relative to the response to CO2 forcing. Anthropogenic CH4 has efficacy ∼110\%, which increases to ∼145\% when its indirect effects on stratospheric H2O and tropospheric O3 are included, yielding an effective climate forcing of ∼0.8 W/m2 for the period 1750–2000 and making CH4 the largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than CO2. Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning have a calculated efficacy ∼58\%, while fossil fuel BC has an efficacy ∼78\%. Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC (organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning BC + OC has a negative forcing. We show that replacement of the traditional instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and temperature changes in a fixed‐ocean model run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial distribution of climate change, normalized to the same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents, suggesting that the global forcing has more relevance to regional climate change than may have been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases intensify the Hadley circulation in our model, increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia, while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics including the Southwest United States, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an expanding Sahel. These features survive in model simulations that use all estimated forcings for the period 1880–2000. Responses to localized forcings, such as land use change and heavy regional concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific regional characteristics. We suggest that anthropogenic tropospheric O3 and the BC snow albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing, Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its efficacy. Fe requires calculation of the climate response and introduces greater model dependence, but once it is calculated for a given amount of a forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the response to other forcing amounts.},

	abstract = {We describe the method of history matching, a method currently used to help quantify parametric uncertainty in climate models, and argue for its use in identifying and removing structural biases in climate models at the model development stage. We illustrate the method using an investigation of the potential to improve upon known ocean circulation biases in a coupled non-flux-adjusted climate model (the third Hadley Centre Climate Model; HadCM3). In particular, we use history matching to investigate whether or not the behaviour of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which is known to be too strong in HadCM3, represents a structural bias that could be corrected using the model parameters. We find that it is possible to improve the ACC strength using the parameters and observe that doing this leads to more realistic representations of the sub-polar and sub-tropical gyres, sea surface salinities (both globally and in the North Atlantic), sea surface temperatures in the sinking regions in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean, North Atlantic Deep Water flows, global precipitation, wind fields and sea level pressure. We then use history matching to locate a region of parameter space predicted not to contain structural biases for ACC and SSTs that is around 1 \% of the original parameter space. We explore qualitative features of this space and show that certain key ocean and atmosphere parameters must be tuned carefully together in order to locate climates that satisfy our chosen metrics. Our study shows that attempts to tune climate model parameters that vary only a handful of parameters relevant to a given process at a time will not be as successful or as efficient as history matching.},

Both models include a physically-based activation scheme that incorporates a size-resolved aerosol population. We demonstrate that the aerosol-induced effect is controlled by the balance between latent heating and the increase in condensed water aloft, each having opposing effects on buoyancy. It is also shown that under polluted conditions, increases in the CCN number concentration reduce the cumulative precipitation due to the competition between the sedimentation and evaporation/sublimation timescales. The effect of an increase in the IN number concentration on the dynamics of deep convective clouds is small and the resulting decrease in domain-averaged cumulative precipitation is shown not to be statistically significant, but may act to suppress precipitation. It is also shown that even in the presence of a decrease in the domain-averaged cumulative precipitation, an increase in the precipitation variance, or in other words, andincrease in rainfall intensity, may be expected in more polluted environments, especially in moist environments.  A significant difference exists between the predictions based on the bin and bulk microphysics schemes of precipitation and the influence of aerosol perturbations on updraft velocity within the convective core. The bulk microphysics scheme shows little change in the latent heating rates due to an increase in the CCN number concentration, while the bin microphysics scheme demonstrates significant increases in the latent heating aloft with increasing CCN number concentration. This suggests that even a detailed two-bulk microphysics scheme, coupled to a detailed activation scheme, may not be sufficient to predict small changes that result from perturbations in aerosol loading.},

The first version focuses on comparing simulated aerosol properties with aircraft, ship, and surface measurements, which are mostly measured in situ. The diagnostics currently cover six field campaigns in four geographical regions: eastern North Atlantic (ENA), central US (CUS), northeastern Pacific (NEP), and Southern Ocean (SO). These regions produce frequent liquid- or mixed-phase clouds, with extensive measurements available from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program and other agencies. Various types of diagnostics and metrics are performed for aerosol number, size distribution, chemical composition, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration, and various meteorological quantities to assess how well E3SM represents observed aerosol properties across spatial scales. Overall, E3SM qualitatively reproduces the observed aerosol number concentration, size distribution, and chemical composition reasonably well, but it overestimates Aitken-mode aerosols and underestimates accumulation-mode aerosols over the CUS and ENA regions, suggesting that processes related to particle growth or coagulation might be too weak in the model. The current version of E3SM struggles to reproduce the new particle formation events frequently observed over both the CUS and ENA regions, indicating missing processes in current parameterizations. The diagnostics package is coded and organized in a way that can be extended to other field campaign datasets and adapted to higher-resolution model simulations.},

	abstract = {The explicit coupling at meter and second scales of vegetation's responses to the atmospheric‐boundary layer dynamics drives a dynamic heterogeneity that influences canopy‐top fluxes and cloud formation. Focusing on a representative day during the Amazonian dry season, we investigate the diurnal cycle of energy, moisture and carbon dioxide at the canopy top, and the transition from clear to cloudy conditions. To this end, we compare results from a large‐eddy simulation technique, a high‐resolution global weather model, and a complete observational data set collected during the GoAmazon14/15 campaign. The overall model‐observation comparisons of radiation and canopy‐top fluxes, turbulence, and cloud dynamics are very satisfactory, with all the modeled variables lying within the standard deviation of the monthly aggregated observations. Our analysis indicates that the timing of the change in the daylight carbon exchange, from a sink to a source, remains uncertain and is probably related to the stomata closure caused by the increase in vapor pressure deficit during the afternoon. We demonstrate quantitatively that heat and moisture transport from the subcloud layer into the cloud layer are misrepresented by the global model, yielding low values of specific humidity and thermal instability above the cloud base. Finally, the numerical simulations and observational data are adequate settings for benchmarking more comprehensive studies of plant responses, microphysics, and radiation. Clouds and forest in the Amazonian rainforest region are closely related. We investigated the final month of the Amazonian dry season in order to study interactions between the rainforest and the overlying atmosphere, placing particular emphasis on studying small spatiotemporal effects, such as that of cloud shading on photosynthesis. We employed three different methods: a cloud‐turbulence resolving model, a global weather model, and a complete set of canopy‐top and atmospheric observations. We holistically studied these relationships by systematically analyzing the characteristics of incoming solar radiation, evapotranspiration, and cloud cover and thickness. This comparison enabled us to make two relevant findings related to these diurnal carbon and cloud cycles. First, we observed that photosynthesis is offset by the soil carbon dioxide efflux earlier than the two models calculations. With respect to cloud formation and intensification, we showed quantitatively that the inefficiently modeled moisture transport leads to less active shallow convection, which may be insufficient to trigger deep convection. This systematic study paves the way for more comprehensive studies that would include more complex descriptions of microphysics processes and radiation, as well as chemistry and aerosol formation. Explicit interactions between carbon uptake and clouds on subdaily and subkilometer scales are modeled and validated NEE observations show an early afternoon shift from a CO2 sink to a source, whereas in the model results, the CO2 uptake is longer Observations and DALES results show enhancement of moisture transport at cloud base that favors triggering afternoon deep convection},

	abstract = {How quickly greenhouse-gas emissions need to be reduced in order to avoid what has been termed dangerous climate change is of fundamental importance. Two papers in this issue tackle the question from different standpoints, yet come to broadly similar conclusions. Meinshausen et al. relate the cumulative emission of greenhouse gasses by 2050 to the probability of exceeding the 2 °C of global warming above pre-industrial temperatures adopted by more than 100 countries as the threshold of dangerous climate change. They find that only about a third of economically recoverable oil, gas and coal reserves can be burned if global warming of 2 °C is to be avoided by 2100, an amount of fossil fuel that would be burned by 2029 if consumption remains at today's levels. Allen et al. use a combined climate and carbon cycle model to produce simulations spanning a range of climate futures consistent with the changes already observed. The 500 billionth tonne of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 was recently released into the atmosphere, and Allen et al. find that releasing a trillion tonnes of carbon in total is likely to cause a peak warming exceeding the 'acceptable' 2 °C temperature increase. Every tonne released thereafter increases the committed maximum warming in a predictable way, regardless of when it is released. Any effective climate mitigation regime must therefore achieve a cap on cumulative carbon dioxide emissions — one trillion tonnes would be a possible though optimistic target. In News and Views, Gavin Schmidt and David Archer consider these papers and other recent work focusing on establishing achievable emissions targets. The effect of a cumulative emission of carbon on peak global mean surface temperature is better constrained than the effect of stabilizing the atmospheric composition. The approach is also insensitive to the timing or peak rate of emissions. Using carbon cycle models, it is shown that a trillion tonnes of carbon emissions (about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began) will produce a most likely peak warming of 2 degrees Celsius. Global efforts to mitigate climate change are guided by projections of future temperatures1. But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain1,2,3, complicating the setting of stabilization targets to avoid potentially dangerous levels of global warming4,5,6,7,8. Similar problems apply to the carbon cycle: observations currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emissions9,10,11. Here we use ensemble simulations of simple climate-carbon-cycle models constrained by observations and projections from more comprehensive models to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathways. We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario. Furthermore, the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (timing of emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets. Total anthropogenic emissions of one trillion tonnes of carbon (3.67 trillion tonnes of CO2), about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began, results in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2 °C above pre-industrial temperatures, with a 5–95\% confidence interval of 1.3–3.9 °C.},

This method does not require special integrations or off‐line estimates, such as for stratospheric adjustment, to obtain the forcing, and eliminates the need for double radiation calculations and tropopause radiative fluxes. We show that for CO2 and solar forcing in a slab model and an AOGCM the method gives results consistent with those obtained by conventional methods.

	abstract = {A simple four‐dimensional assimilation technique, called Newtonian relaxation, has been applied to the Hamburg climate model (ECHAM), to enable comparison of model output with observations for short periods of time. The prognostic model variables vorticity, divergence, temperature, and surface pressure have been relaxed toward European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global meteorological analyses. Several experiments have been carried out, in which the values of the relaxation coefficients have been varied to find out which values are most usable for our purpose. To be able to use the method for validation of model physics or chemistry, good agreement of the model simulated mass and wind field is required. In addition, the model physics should not be disturbed too strongly by the relaxation forcing itself. Both aspects have been investigated. Good agreement with basic observed quantities, like wind, temperature, and pressure is obtained for most simulations in the extratropics. Derived variables, like precipitation and evaporation, have been compared with ECMWF forecasts and observations. Agreement for these variables is smaller than for the basic observed quantities. Nevertheless, considerable improvement is obtained relative to a control run without assimilation. Differences between tropics and extratropics are smaller than for the basic observed quantities. Results also show that precipitation and evaporation are affected by a sort of continuous spin‐up which is introduced by the relaxation: the bias (ECMWF‐ECHAM) is increasing with increasing relaxation forcing. In agreement with this result we found that with increasing relaxation forcing the vertical exchange of tracers by turbulent boundary layer mixing and, in a lesser extent, by convection, is reduced.},

	abstract = {Reduced-complexity climate models (RCMs) are critical in the policy and decision making space, and are directly used within multiple Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports to complement the results of more comprehensive Earth system models. To date, evaluation of RCMs has been limited to a few independent studies. Here we introduce a systematic evaluation of RCMs in the form of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP). We expect RCMIP will extend over multiple phases, with Phase 1 being the first. In Phase 1, we focus on the RCMs' global-mean temperature responses, comparing them to observations, exploring the extent to which they emulate more complex models and considering how the relationship between temperature and cumulative emissions of CO2 varies across the RCMs. Our work uses experiments which mirror those found in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which focuses on complex Earth system and atmosphere–ocean general circulation models. Using both scenario-based and idealised experiments, we examine RCMs' global-mean temperature response under a range of forcings. We find that the RCMs can all reproduce the approximately 1 ∘C of warming since pre-industrial times, with varying representations of natural variability, volcanic eruptions and aerosols. We also find that RCMs can emulate the global-mean temperature response of CMIP models to within a root-mean-square error of 0.2 ∘C over a range of experiments. Furthermore, we find that, for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)-based scenario pairs that share the same IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)-consistent stratospheric-adjusted radiative forcing, the RCMs indicate higher effective radiative forcings for the SSP-based scenarios and correspondingly higher temperatures when run with the same climate settings. In our idealised setup of RCMs with a climate sensitivity of 3 ∘C, the difference for the ssp585–rcp85 pair by 2100 is around 0.23∘C(±0.12 ∘C) due to a difference in effective radiative forcings between the two scenarios. Phase 1 demonstrates the utility of RCMIP's open-source infrastructure, paving the way for further phases of RCMIP to build on the research presented here and deepen our understanding of RCMs.},

In this Review, we discuss current evidence regarding the transmission of respiratory viruses by aerosols—how they are generated, transported, and deposited, as well as the factors affecting the relative contributions of droplet-spray deposition versus aerosol inhalation as modes of transmission. Improved understanding of aerosol transmission brought about by studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires a reevaluation of the major transmission pathways for other respiratory viruses, which will allow better-informed controls to reduce airborne transmission.},

With sufficient growth, these nucleated particles may be a significant source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thus altering cloud albedo, structure, and lifetimes, and insolation reaching the Earth’s surface. Herein we present one of the first numerical experiments conducted at sufficiently high resolution and fidelity to quantify the impact of NPF on cloud radiative properties. Consistent with observations in spring over the Midwestern USA, NPF occurs frequently and on regional scales. However, NPF is not associated with enhancement of regional cloud albedo. These simulations indicate that NPF reduces ambient sulfuric acid concentrations sufficiently to inhibit growth of preexisting particles to CCN sizes, reduces CCN-sized particle concentrations, and reduces cloud albedo. The reduction in cloud albedo on NPF days results in a domain average positive top of atmosphere cloud radiative forcing, and thus warming, of 10 W m−2 and up to {\textasciitilde}50 W m−2 in individual grid cells relative to a simulation in which NPF is excluded. Against expectation, aerosol particles formed from nucleation of gas-phase species do not increase aerosol indirect radiative forcing (IRF). An international team led by Ryan Sullivan at Cornell University present one of the first numerical experiments conducted at sufficiently high resolution and fidelity to quantify the impact of new particle formation (NPF) on cloud radiative properties. Previous research suggests that the majority of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are from NPF, and therefore NPF should increase cloud albedo and IRF. However, the simulations found that in polluted environments, NPF can reduce ambient condensable vapor concentrations sufficiently to inhibit growth of pre-existing aerosols to CCN size, and decrease cloud albedo and IRF. This highlights the importance of explicitly resolving complex cloud-aerosol processes to better understand and characterize IRF and specifically the contribution from NPF.},

	abstract = {A major source of the primary marine aerosol is the bursting of air bubbles produced by breaking waves. Several source parameterizations are available from the literature, usually limited to particles with a dry diameter Dp {\textgreater} 1 μm. The objective of this work is to extend the current knowledge to submicrometer particles. Bubbles were generated in synthetic seawater using a sintered glass filter, with a size spectra that are only partly the same spectra as measured in the field. Bubble spectra, and size distributions of the resulting aerosol (0.020–20.0 μm Dp) of the resulting aerosol, were measured for different salinity, water temperature (Tw), and bubble flux. The spectra show a minimum at ∼1 μm Dp, which separates two modes, one at ∼0.1 μm, with the largest number of particles, and one at 2.5 μm Dp. The modes show different behavior with the variation of salinity and water temperature. When the water temperature increases, the number concentration Np decreases for Dp {\textless} 0.07 μm, whereas for Dp {\textgreater} 0.35 μm, Np increases. The salinity effect suggests different droplet formation processes for droplets smaller and larger than 0.2 μm Dp. The number of particles produced per size increment, time unit, and whitecap surface (Φ) is described as a linear function of Tw and a polynomial function of Dp. Combining Φ with the whitecap coverage fraction W (in percent), an expression results for the primary marine aerosol source flux dF0/dlogDp = W Φ (m−2 s−1). The results are compared with other commonly used formulations as well as with recent field observations. Implications for aerosol‐induced effects on climate are discussed.},

	abstract = {Parameters in climate models are usually calibrated manually, exploiting only small subsets of the available data. This precludes an optimal calibration and quantification of uncertainties. Traditional Bayesian calibration methods that allow uncertainty quantification are too expensive for climate models; they are also not robust in the presence of internal climate variability. For example, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically require \$O(10{\textasciicircum}5)\$ model runs, rendering them infeasible for climate models. Here we demonstrate an approach to model calibration and uncertainty quantification that requires only \$O(10{\textasciicircum}2)\$ model runs and can accommodate internal climate variability. The approach consists of three stages: (i) a calibration stage uses variants of ensemble Kalman inversion to calibrate a model by minimizing mismatches between model and data statistics; (ii) an emulation stage emulates the parameter-to-data map with Gaussian processes (GP), using the model runs in the calibration stage for training; (iii) a sampling stage approximates the Bayesian posterior distributions by using the GP emulator and then samples using MCMC. We demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of this calibrate-emulate-sample (CES) approach in a perfect-model setting. Using an idealized general circulation model, we estimate parameters in a simple convection scheme from data surrogates generated with the model. The CES approach generates probability distributions of the parameters that are good approximations of the Bayesian posteriors, at a fraction of the computational cost usually required to obtain them. Sampling from this approximate posterior allows the generation of climate predictions with quantified parametric uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols are composed of a variety of aerosol types and components including water-soluble inorganic species (e.g., sulfate, nitrate, ammonium), condensed organic species, elemental or black carbon, and mineral dust. Previous estimates of the clear sky forcing by anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and by organic biomass-burning aerosols indicate that this forcing is of sufficient magnitude to mask the effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases over large regions. Here, the uncertainty in the forcing by these aerosol types is estimated. The clear sky forcing by other anthropogenic aerosol components cannot be estimated with confidence, although the forcing by these aerosol types appears to be smaller than that by sulfate and biomass-burning aerosols. The cloudy sky forcing by anthropogenic aerosols, wherein aerosol cloud condensation nuclei concentrations are increased, thereby increasing cloud droplet concentrations and cloud albedo and possibly influencing cloud persistence, may also be significant. In contrast to the situation with the clear sky forcing, estimates of the cloudy sky forcing by anthropogenic aerosols are little more than guesses, and it is not possible to quantify the uncertainty of the estimates. In view of present concerns over greenhouse gas–induced climate change, this situation dictates the need to quantify the forcing by anthropogenic aerosols and to define and minimize uncertainties in the calculated forcings. In this article, a research strategy for improving the estimates of the clear sky forcing is defined. The strategy encompasses five major, and necessarily coordinated, activities: surface-based observations of aerosol chemical and physical properties and their influence on the radiation field; aircraft-based observations of the same properties; process studies to refine model treatments; satellite observations of aerosol abundance and size distribution; and modeling studies to demonstrate consistency between the observations, to provide guidance for determination of the most important parameters, and to allow extension of the limited set of observations to the global scale. Such a strategy, if aggressively implemented, should allow these effects to be incorporated into climate models in the next several years. A similar strategy for defining the magnitude of the cloudy sky forcing should also be possible, but the less firm understanding of this forcing suggests that research of a more exploratory nature be carried out before undertaking a research strategy of the magnitude recommended for the clear sky forcing.},

	abstract = {Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous general circulation climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multimodel ensembles sample initial conditions, parameters, and structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantifying uncertainty in future climate change. International climate change assessments also rely heavily on these models. These assessments often provide equal-weighted averages as best-guess results, assuming that individual model biases will at least partly cancel and that a model average prediction is more likely to be correct than a prediction from a single model based on the result that a multimodel average of present-day climate generally outperforms any individual model. This study outlines the motivation for using multimodel ensembles and discusses various challenges in interpreting them. Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behavior is often not sampled. Model skill in simulating present-day climate conditions is shown to relate only weakly to the magnitude of predicted change. It is thus unclear by how much the confidence in future projections should increase based on improvements in simulating present-day conditions, a reduction of intermodel spread, or a larger number of models. Averaging model output may further lead to a loss of signal—for example, for precipitation change where the predicted changes are spatially heterogeneous, such that the true expected change is very likely to be larger than suggested by a model average. Last, there is little agreement on metrics to separate “good” and “bad” models, and there is concern that model development, evaluation, and posterior weighting or ranking are all using the same datasets. While the multimodel average appears to still be useful in some situations, these results show that more quantitative methods to evaluate model performance are critical to maximize the value of climate change projections from global models.},

	abstract = {Advances in high‐performance computing have enabled large‐eddy simulations (LES) of turbulence, convection, and clouds. However, their potential to improve parameterizations in global climate models (GCMs) is only beginning to be harnessed, with relatively few canonical LES available so far. The purpose of this paper is to begin creating a public LES library that expands the training data available for calibrating and evaluating GCM parameterizations. To do so, we use an experimental setup in which LES are driven by large‐scale forcings from GCMs, which in principle can be used at any location, any time of year, and in any climate state. We use this setup to create a library of LES of clouds across the tropics and subtropics, in the present and in a warmer climate, with a focus on the transition from stratocumulus to shallow cumulus over the East Pacific. The LES results are relatively insensitive to the choice of host GCM driving the LES. Driven with large‐scale forcing under global warming, the LES simulate a positive but weak shortwave cloud feedback, adding to the accumulating evidence that low clouds amplify global warming. Clouds remain one of the largest uncertainties in our understanding and in predictions of climate change because it is challenging to represent their small‐scale dynamics in climate models. However, high‐resolution simulations can provide faithful simulations of clouds and turbulence in limited areas, and these can be used to calibrate climate models. So far, only a limited set of simulations has been used for calibration of climate models, with focus on a few specific locations. This study presents an experimental setup that allows the high‐resolution simulations to be run anywhere on the globe, in any climate state, driven by output from different climate models.

	abstract = {The Observations for Model Intercomparison Project (Obs4MIPs) was initiated in 2010 to facilitate the use of observations in climate model evaluation and research, with a particular target being the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), a major initiative of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). To this end, Obs4MIPs (1) targets observed variables that can be compared to CMIP model variables; (2) utilizes dataset formatting specifications and metadata requirements closely aligned with CMIP model output; (3) provides brief technical documentation for each dataset, designed for nonexperts and tailored towards relevance for model evaluation, including information on uncertainty, dataset merits, and limitations; and (4) disseminates the data through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) platforms, making the observations searchable and accessible via the same portals as the model output. Taken together, these characteristics of the organization and structure of obs4MIPs should entice a more diverse community of researchers to engage in the comparison of model output with observations and to contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation of the climate models. At present, the number of obs4MIPs datasets has grown to about 80; many are undergoing updates, with another 20 or so in preparation, and more than 100 are proposed and under consideration. A partial list of current global satellite-based datasets includes humidity and temperature profiles; a wide range of cloud and aerosol observations; ocean surface wind, temperature, height, and sea ice fraction; surface and top-of-atmosphere longwave and shortwave radiation; and ozone (O3), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) products. A partial list of proposed products expected to be useful in analyzing CMIP6 results includes the following: alternative products for the above quantities, additional products for ocean surface flux and chlorophyll products, a number of vegetation products (e.g., FAPAR, LAI, burned area fraction), ice sheet mass and height, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). While most existing obs4MIPs datasets consist of monthly-mean gridded data over the global domain, products with higher time resolution (e.g., daily) and/or regional products are now receiving more attention. Along with an increasing number of datasets, obs4MIPs has implemented a number of capability upgrades including (1) an updated obs4MIPs data specifications document that provides additional search facets and generally improves congruence with CMIP6 specifications for model datasets, (2) a set of six easily understood indicators that help guide users as to a dataset's maturity and suitability for application, and (3) an option to supply supplemental information about a dataset beyond what can be found in the standard metadata. With the maturation of the obs4MIPs framework, the dataset inclusion process, and the dataset formatting guidelines and resources, the scope of the observations being considered is expected to grow to include gridded in situ datasets as well as datasets with a regional focus, and the ultimate intent is to judiciously expand this scope to any observation dataset that has applicability for evaluation of the types of Earth system models used in CMIP.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Twomey effect describes the radiative forcing associated with a change in cloud albedo due to an increase in anthropogenic aerosol emissions. It is driven by the perturbation in cloud droplet number concentration (ΔNd,ant) in liquid-water clouds and is currently understood to exert a cooling effect on climate. The Twomey effect is the key driver in the effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–cloud interactions which also comprises rapid adjustments. These adjustments are essentially the responses of cloud fraction and liquid water path to ΔNd,ant and thus scale approximately with it. While the fundamental physics of the influence of added aerosol particles on the droplet concentration (Nd) is well described by established theory at the particle scale (micrometres), how this relationship is expressed at the large scale (hundreds of kilometres) ΔNd,ant remains uncertain. The discrepancy between process understanding at particle scale and insufficient quantification at the climate-relevant large scale is caused by co-variability of aerosol particles and vertical wind and by droplet sink processes. These operate at scales on the order of 10s of metres at which only localized observations are available and at which no approach exists yet to quantify the anthropogenic perturbation. Different atmospheric models suggest diverse magnitudes of the Twomey effect even when applying the same anthropogenic aerosol emission perturbation. Thus, observational data are needed to quantify and constrain the Twomey effect. At the global scale, this means satellite data. There are three key uncertainties in determining ΔNd,ant, namely the quantification (i) of the cloud-active aerosol – the cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (CCN) at or above cloud base –, (ii) of Nd, as well as (iii) the statistical approach for inferring the sensitivity of Nd to aerosol particles from the satellite data. A fourth uncertainty, the anthropogenic perturbation to CCN concentrations, is also not easily accessible from observational data. This review discusses deficiencies of current approaches for the different aspects of the problem and proposes several ways forward: In terms of CCN, retrievals of optical quantities such as aerosol optical depth suffer from a lack of vertical resolution, size and hygroscopicity information, the non-direct relation to the concentration of aerosols, the impossibility to quantify it within or below clouds, and the problem of insufficient sensitivity at low concentrations, in addition to retrieval errors. A future path forward can include utilizing colocated polarimeter and lidar instruments, ideally including high spectral resolution lidar capability at two wavelengths to maximize vertically resolved size distribution information content. In terms of Nd, a key problem is the lack of operational retrievals of this quantity, and the inaccuracy of the retrieval especially in broken-cloud regimes. As for the Nd – to – CCN sensitivity, key issues are the updraught distributions and the role of Nd sink processes, for which empirical assessments for specific cloud regimes are currently the best solutions. These considerations point to the conclusion that past studies using existing approaches have likely underestimated the true sensitivity and, thus, the radiative forcing due to the Twomey effect.},

	abstract = {Impacts of absorbing and scattering aerosols on global energy balance are investigated with a global climate model. A series of sensitivity experiments perturbing emissions of black carbon and sulfate aerosols individually is conducted with the model to explore how components of global energy budget change in response to the instantaneous radiative forcing due to the two types of aerosols. It is demonstrated how differing vertical structures of the instantaneous radiative forcing between the two aerosols induce distinctively different proportions of fast and slow climate responses through different energy redistribution into atmosphere and surface. These characteristics are quantified in the form of the whole picture of global energy budget perturbations normalized by the top‐of‐atmosphere instantaneous radiative forcing. The energy budget perturbation per “unit” instantaneous forcing thus quantified reveals relative magnitudes of changes to different component fluxes in restoring atmospheric and surface energy balances through fast and slow responses. The normalized picture then directly links the “initial forcing” to the eventual climate “responses”, thereby explaining how starkly different responses of the global‐mean temperature and precipitation are induced by the two types of aerosols. The study underscores a critical need for better quantifications of the forcings' vertical structure and atmospheric rapid adjustment for reliable estimates of climatic impact of absorbing and scattering aerosols. In particular, cloud responses through the indirect and semi‐direct effects and the sensible heat decrease in response to stabilized atmosphere due to the black carbon heating are identified as key uncertain components in the global energy budget perturbation. The minute particles suspended in the atmosphere, called aerosols, have warming or cooling impacts on climate depending on their “color” that determines their ability to scatter or absorb the sunlight. The “black” aerosols, like black carbon, enhance the heating on atmosphere and reduce the sunlight reaching the surface through absorbing the sunlight while the “white” aerosols, like sulfate, directly cool the surface with little influence on atmosphere through scattering the sunlight. This study analyzes simulations with a global climate model to quantify how the two types of aerosols with such different characteristics modulate the Earth's energy budget differently to induce distinctively different responses of the global‐mean temperature and precipitation. The results explain why the global temperature response to perturbations of black carbon tends to be muted in contrast to the pronounced response to perturbations of sulfate. The energy budget picture also illustrates how increased black carbon can increase and decrease the global precipitation through two competing pathways to result a net decrease while increased sulfate monotonically decreases the global precipitation. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for better quantifying the climate change driven by future emission changes of different types of aerosols. Impacts of absorbing and scattering aerosols on global energy budget are quantified in the way scaled by instantaneous radiative forcing The normalized picture of energy budget perturbation directly links the instantaneous radiative forcing to climate responses The cloud and sensible heat responses are identified as key uncertainties in quantifying the climatic impacts of the two aerosols},

	abstract = {Southern Africa produces almost a third of the Earth's biomass burning (BB) aerosol particles, yet the fate of these particles and their influence on regional and global climate is poorly understood. ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) is a 5-year NASA EVS-2 (Earth Venture Suborbital-2) investigation with three intensive observation periods designed to study key atmospheric processes that determine the climate impacts of these aerosols. During the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring (June–October), aerosol particles reaching 3–5 km in altitude are transported westward over the southeast Atlantic, where they interact with one of the largest subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) cloud decks in the world. The representation of these interactions in climate models remains highly uncertain in part due to a scarcity of observational constraints on aerosol and cloud properties, as well as due to the parameterized treatment of physical processes. Three ORACLES deployments by the NASA P-3 aircraft in September 2016, August 2017, and October 2018 (totaling ∼350 science flight hours), augmented by the deployment of the NASA ER-2 aircraft for remote sensing in September 2016 (totaling ∼100 science flight hours), were intended to help fill this observational gap. ORACLES focuses on three fundamental science themes centered on the climate effects of African BB aerosols: (a) direct aerosol radiative effects, (b) effects of aerosol absorption on atmospheric circulation and clouds, and (c) aerosol–cloud microphysical interactions. This paper summarizes the ORACLES science objectives, describes the project implementation, provides an overview of the flights and measurements in each deployment, and highlights the integrative modeling efforts from cloud to global scales to address science objectives. Significant new findings on the vertical structure of BB aerosol physical and chemical properties, chemical aging, cloud condensation nuclei, rain and precipitation statistics, and aerosol indirect effects are emphasized, but their detailed descriptions are the subject of separate publications. The main purpose of this paper is to familiarize the broader scientific community with the ORACLES project and the dataset it produced.},

	abstract = {Changes in global-mean precipitation are strongly constrained by global radiative cooling, while regional rainfall changes are less constrained because energy can be transported. Absorbing and non-absorbing aerosols have different effects on both global-mean and regional precipitation, due to the distinct effects on energetics. This study analyses the precipitation responses to large perturbations in black carbon (BC) and sulfate (SUL) by examining the changes in atmospheric energy budget terms on global and regional scales, in terms of fast (independent of changes in sea surface temperature, SST) and slow responses (mediated by changes in SST). Changes in atmospheric radiative cooling/heating are further decomposed into contributions from clouds, aerosols, and clear–clean sky (without clouds or aerosols). Both cases show a decrease in global-mean precipitation, which is dominated by fast responses in the BC case and slow responses in the SUL case. The geographical patterns are distinct too. The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), accompanied by tropical rainfall, shifts northward in the BC case, while it shifts southward in the SUL case. For both cases, energy transport terms from the slow response dominate the changes in tropical rainfall, which are associated with the northward (southward) shift of the Hadley cell in response to the enhanced southward (northward) cross-equatorial energy flux caused by increased BC (SUL) emission. The extra-tropical precipitation decreases in both cases. For the BC case, fast responses to increased atmospheric radiative heating contribute most to the reduced rainfall, in which absorbing aerosols directly heat the mid-troposphere, stabilise the column, and suppress precipitation. Unlike BC, non-absorbing aerosols decrease surface temperatures through slow processes, cool the whole atmospheric column, and reduce specific humidity, which leads to decreased radiative cooling from the clear–clean sky, which is consistent with the reduced rainfall. Examining the changes in large-scale circulation and local thermodynamics qualitatively explains the responses of precipitation to aerosol perturbations, whereas the energetic perspective provides a method to quantify their contributions.},

Its major objectives aimed at (i) investigating the extent and persistence of the outflow of pollution from Mexico; (ii) understanding transport and evolution of Asian pollution and implications for air quality and climate across western North America; and (iii) validating space-borne observations of tropospheric composition. INTEX-B was performed in two phases. In its first phase (1–21 March), INTEX-B operated as part of the MILAGRO campaign with a focus on observations over Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. In the second phase (17 April–15 May), the main INTEX-B focus was on the trans-Pacific Asian pollution transport. Multiple airborne platforms carrying state of the art chemistry and radiation payloads were flown in concert with satellites and ground stations during the two phases of INTEX-B. Validation of Aura satellite instruments (TES, OMI, MLS, HIRDLS) was a key objective within INTEX-B. Satellite products along with meteorological and 3-D chemical transport model forecasts were integrated into the flight planning process to allow targeted sampling of air parcels. Inter-comparisons were performed among and between aircraft payloads to quantify the accuracy of data and to create a unified data set. Pollution plumes were sampled over the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific several days after downwind transport from source regions. Signatures of Asian pollution were routinely detected by INTEX-B aircraft, providing a comprehensive data set on gas and aerosol composition to test models and evaluate pathways of pollution transport and their impact on air quality and climate.

Major changes have been brought into the model, including new parameterizations for aerosol nucleation and water uptake, an explicit treatment of secondary organic aerosols, modified emission calculations for sea salt and mineral dust, the coupling of aerosol microphysics to a two-moment stratiform cloud microphysics scheme, and alternative wet scavenging parameterizations. These revisions extend the model's capability to represent details of the aerosol lifecycle and its interaction with climate. Nudged simulations of the year 2000 are carried out to compare the aerosol properties and global distribution in HAM1 and HAM2, and to evaluate them against various observations. Sensitivity experiments are performed to help identify the impact of each individual update in model formulation. Results indicate that from HAM1 to HAM2 there is a marked weakening of aerosol water uptake in the lower troposphere, reducing the total aerosol water burden from 75 Tg to 51 Tg. The main reason is the newly introduced κ-Köhler-theory-based water uptake scheme uses a lower value for the maximum relative humidity cutoff. Particulate organic matter loading in HAM2 is considerably higher in the upper troposphere, because the explicit treatment of secondary organic aerosols allows highly volatile oxidation products of the precursors to be vertically transported to regions of very low temperature and to form aerosols there. Sulfate, black carbon, particulate organic matter and mineral dust in HAM2 have longer lifetimes than in HAM1 because of weaker in-cloud scavenging, which is in turn related to lower autoconversion efficiency in the newly introduced two-moment cloud microphysics scheme. Modification in the sea salt emission scheme causes a significant increase in the ratio (from 1.6 to 7.7) between accumulation mode and coarse mode emission fluxes of aerosol number concentration. This leads to a general increase in the number concentration of smaller particles over the oceans in HAM2, as reflected by the higher Ångström parameters. Evaluation against observation reveals that in terms of model performance, main improvements in HAM2 include a marked decrease of the systematic negative bias in the absorption aerosol optical depth, as well as smaller biases over the oceans in Ångström parameter and in the accumulation mode number concentration. The simulated geographical distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is better correlated with the MODIS data, while the surface aerosol mass concentrations are very similar to those in the old version. The total aerosol water content in HAM2 is considerably closer to the multi-model average from Phase I of the AeroCom intercomparison project. Model deficiencies that require further efforts in the future include (i) positive biases in AOD over the ocean, (ii) negative biases in AOD and aerosol mass concentration in high-latitude regions, and (iii) negative biases in particle number concentration, especially that of the Aitken mode, in the lower troposphere in heavily polluted regions.},

	abstract = {A common challenge in modeling inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments with computer simulations is that many of the simulation inputs are unknown and cannot be directly measured. Often, parameters that are measured in the experiment are used to infer the unknown inputs by solving the inverse problem: finding the set of simulation inputs that result in outputs consistent with the experimental observations. In ICF, this process is often referred to as a “post‐shot analysis.” Post‐shot analyses are challenging as the inverse problem is often highly degenerate, the input parameter space is vast, and simulations are computationally expensive. In this work, deep neural network models equipped with model uncertainty estimates are used to train inverse models, which map directly from output to input space, to find the distribution of post‐shot simulations that are consistent with experimental observations. The inverse model approach is compared to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the forward model, which maps from input to output space, for parameter inference tasks of varying complexity. The inverse models perform best when searching vast parameter spaces for post‐shot simulations that are consistent with a large number of observables, where MCMC sampling can be prohibitively expensive. We demonstrate how augmenting inverse models with autoencoders enable the inclusion of several dozen observables in the inverse mapping, reducing the degeneracy of the model and improving the accuracy of the post‐shot analysis.},

To help resolve this question we calculate probability distributions of the committed warming that would ensue if all anthropogenic emissions were stopped immediately, or at successive future times. We use a simple Earth system model together with a Bayesian approach that incorporates multiple lines of evidence and accounts for known model biases. This analysis reveals a wide range of possible outcomes, including no further warming, but also a 15\% chance of overshooting the 1.5 ∘C target, and 1\%–2\% chance for 2 ∘C, even if all emissions had stopped in 2020. If emissions merely stabilize in 2020 and stop in 2040, these probabilities increase to 90\% and 17\%. The uncertainty arises mainly from that of present forcing by aerosols. Rather than there being a fixed date by which emissions must stop, the probability of reaching either target—which is already below 100\%—gradually diminishes with delays in eliminating emissions, by 3\%–4\% per year for 1.5 ∘C.},

	abstract = {The use of crowdsourcing – obtaining large quantities of data through the Internet – has been of great value in urban meteorology. Crowdsourcing has been used to obtain urban air temperature, air pressure, and precipitation data from sources such as mobile phones or personal weather stations (PWSs), but so far wind data have not been researched. Urban wind behaviour is highly variable and challenging to measure, since observations strongly depend on the location and instrumental set‐up. Crowdsourcing can provide a dense network of wind observations and may give insight into the spatial pattern of urban wind. In this study, we evaluate the skill of the popular “Netatmo” PWS anemometer against a reference for a rural and an urban site. Subsequently, we use crowdsourced wind speed observations from 60 PWSs in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to analyse wind speed distributions of different Local Climate Zones (LCZs). The Netatmo PWS anemometer appears to systematically underestimate the wind speed, and episodes with rain or high relative humidity degrade the measurement quality. Therefore, we developed a quality assurance (QA) protocol to correct PWS measurements for these errors. The applied QA protocol strongly improves PWS data to a point where they can be used to infer the probability density distribution of wind speed of a city or neighbourhood. This density distribution consists of a combination of two Weibull distributions, rather than the typical single Weibull distribution used for rural wind speed observations. The limited capability of the Netatmo PWS anemometer to measure near‐zero wind speed causes the QA protocol to perform poorly for periods with very low wind speeds. However, results for a year‐long wind speed climatology of the wind speed are satisfactory, as well as for a shorter period with higher wind speeds. We research the value of crowdsourced urban wind observations from Personal Weather Stations. From comparison measurements against known wind speeds at two sites, we construct a Quality Assurance protocol to improve data quality. After applying this protocol, the crowdsourced data can successfully be used to calculate the urban wind speed probability distribution.},

	abstract = {Singular vectors of the linearized equations of motion have been used to study the instability properties of the atmosphere–ocean system and its related predictability. A third use of these singular vectors is proposed here: as part of a strategy to target adaptive observations to “sensitive” parts of the atmosphere. Such observations could be made using unmanned aircraft, though calculations in this paper are motivated by the upstream component of the Fronts and Atlantic Storm-Track Experiment. Oceanic applications are also discussed. In defining this strategy, it is shown that there is, in principle, no freedom in the choice of inner product or metric for the singular vector calculation. However, the correct metric is dependent on the purpose for making the targeted observations (to study precursor developments or to improve forecast initial conditions). It is argued that for predictability studies, where both the dynamical instability properties of the system and the specification of the operational observing network and associated data assimilation system are important, the appropriate metric will differ from that appropriate to a pure geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) problem. Based on two different sets of calculations, it is argued that for predictability studies (but not for GFD studies), a first-order approximation to the appropriate metric can be based on perturbation energy. The role of observations in data assimilation procedures (constraining large scales more than small scales) is fundamental in understanding reasons for the requirement for different metrics for the two classes of problems. An index-based tensor approach is used to make explicit the role of the metric. The strategy for using singular vectors to target adaptive observations is discussed in the context of other possible approaches, specifically, based on breeding vectors, potential vorticity diagnosis, and sensitivity vectors. The basic premises underlying the use of breeding and singular vectors are discussed. A comparison of the growth rates of breeding and singular vectors is made using a T21 quasigeostrophic model. Singular vectors and subjective potential vorticity (PV) diagnosis are compared for a particular case study. The areas of sensitivity indicated by the two methods only partially agree. Reasons for disagreement hinge around the fact that subjective PV diagnosis emphasizes Lagrangian advection, whereas singular vector analysis emphasizes wave propagation. For the latter, areas of sensitivity may be associated with regions of weak PV gradient, for example, mid to lower troposphere. Amplification of singular vectors propagating from regions of weak PV gradient to regions of strong PV gradient is discussed in terms of pseudomomentum conservation. Evidence is shown that analysis error may be as large in the lower midtroposphere as in the upper troposphere.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Motivated by recent discussions concerning differences of convective dynamics in polluted and pristine environments, the so-called convective invigoration in particular, this paper provides an analysis of factors affecting convective updraft buoyancy, such as the in-cloud supersaturation, condensate and precipitation loading, and entrainment. We use the deep convective period from simulations of daytime convection development over land discussed in our previous publications. An entraining parcel framework in used in the theoretical analysis. We show that for the specific case considered here finite (positive) supersaturation noticeably reduces pseudo-adiabatic parcel buoyancy and cumulative CAPE in the lower troposphere. This comes from keeping a small fraction of the water vapor in a supersaturated state and thus reducing the latent heating. Such a lower-tropospheric impact is comparable to the effects of the condensate loading and entrainment in the idealized parcel framework. For the entire tropospheric depth, loading and entrainment have a much more significant impact on the total CAPE. For instance, an increase in the fractional entrainment rate from 0.05 km−1 to 0.3 km−1 reduces the theoretical level of neutral buoyancy from the upper to the middle troposphere and CAPE by a factor of 4. For the cloud model results, we compare ensemble simulations applying either a bulk microphysics scheme with saturation adjustment or a more comprehensive double-moment scheme with supersaturation prediction. The diagnosed bulk fractional entrainment rate, independent of the microphysics scheme applied in the simulations, is either 0.13 or 0.20 km−1 depending on whether we consider profiles of the upper end of the percentile range or of the mean in-cloud equivalent potential temperature. We compare deep convective updrafts, buoyancies, and supersaturations from all ensembles. In agreement with the parcel analysis, the saturation adjustment scheme provides noticeably stronger updrafts in the lower troposphere. For the simulations predicting supersaturation, there are small differences between pristine and polluted conditions below the freezing level that are difficult to explain by standard analysis of the in-cloud buoyancy components. By applying the piggybacking technique, we show that the lower-tropospheric buoyancy differences between pristine and polluted simulations come from a combination of temperature (i.e., latent heating) and condensate loading differences that work together to make polluted buoyancies and updraft velocities slightly larger when compared to their pristine analogues. Overall, the effects are rather small and contradict previous claims of a significant invigoration of deep convection in polluted environments.},

To accelerate training, we introduce Reducible Holdout Loss Selection (RHO-LOSS), a simple but principled technique which selects approximately those points for training that most reduce the model's generalization loss. As a result, RHO-LOSS mitigates the weaknesses of existing data selection methods: techniques from the optimization literature typically select 'hard' (e.g. high loss) points, but such points are often noisy (not learnable) or less task-relevant. Conversely, curriculum learning prioritizes 'easy' points, but such points need not be trained on once learned. In contrast, RHO-LOSS selects points that are learnable, worth learning, and not yet learnt. RHO-LOSS trains in far fewer steps than prior art, improves accuracy, and speeds up training on a wide range of datasets, hyperparameters, and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and BERT). On the large web-scraped image dataset Clothing-1M, RHO-LOSS trains in 18x fewer steps and reaches 2\% higher final accuracy than uniform data shuffling.},

Both types of sulfate particles lack combustion tracers and correlate, for some conditions, to atmospheric or seawater dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentrations, which means their source was largely biogenic. The first type is identified as New Sulfate because their large sulfate mass fraction (63\% sulfate) and association with entrainment conditions means they could have formed by nucleation in the free troposphere.

New Sulfate particles accounted for 31\% (7 cm−3) and 33\% (36 cm−3) CCN at 0.1\% supersaturation in late-autumn and late-spring, respectively, whereas sea spray provided 55\% (13 cm−3) in late-autumn but only 4\% (4 cm−3) in late-spring.

The model is forced by ECMWF analyses to simulate September 1993, and results are compared to observations on different spatial and temporal scales: monthly mean horizontal satellite data, daily mean averages at European and Canadian stations and aircraft soundings over the north Atlantic off the Canadian coast. The model is able to reproduce monthly mean horizontal distributions of liquid water path and precipitation. Daily mean precipitation fluxes and the temporal evolution of gaseous and particulate sulphur also agree quite well with observations. Based on this comparison with observations the performance of two different cloud physics parametrizations is discussed. These experiments indicate that variables like relative humidity, cloud cover and precipitation are controlled by the large-scale dynamics, whereas the cloud water content depends on the parametrization of the cloud microphysics. Coupling of the model-calculated sulphate mixing ratios to the cloud microphysics improves the model's sulphate distribution but slightly worsens the agreement between calculated and observed precipitation.},

Recent studies have claimed that this so-termed Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is instead a manifestation of competing time-varying effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. That conclusion is bolstered by the absence of robust multidecadal climate oscillations in control simulations of current-generation models. Paleoclimate data, however, do demonstrate multidecadal oscillatory behavior during the preindustrial era. By comparing control and forced “Last Millennium” simulations, we show that these apparent multidecadal oscillations are an artifact of pulses of volcanic activity during the preindustrial era that project markedly onto the multidecadal (50- to 70-year) frequency band. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for internal multidecadal oscillations in the climate system.},

	abstract = {Aerosols can influence cloud radiative effects and, thus, may alter interpretation of how Earth’s radiative budget responds to climate forcing. Three different ensemble experiments from the same climate model with different greenhouse gas and aerosol scenarios are used to analyze the role of aerosols in climate feedbacks and their spread across initial condition ensembles of transient climate simulations. The standard deviation of global feedback parameters across ensemble members is low, typically 0.02 W m−2 K−1. Feedbacks from high (8.5 W m−2) and moderate (4.5 W m−2) year 2100 forcing cases are nearly identical. An aerosol kernel is introduced to remove effects of aerosol cloud interactions that alias into cloud feedbacks. Adjusted cloud feedbacks indicate an “aerosol feedback” resulting from changes to climate that increase sea-salt emissions, mostly in the Southern Ocean. Ensemble simulations also indicate higher tropical cloud feedbacks with higher aerosol loading. These effects contribute to a difference in cloud feedbacks of nearly 50\% between ensembles of the same model. These two effects are also seen in aquaplanet simulations with varying fixed drop number. Thus aerosols can be a significant modifier of cloud feedbacks, and different representations of aerosols and their interactions with clouds may contribute to multimodel spread in climate feedbacks and climate sensitivity in multimodel archives.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty in the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of climate primarily arises from the unknown contribution of aerosols, which impact radiative fluxes directly and through modifying cloud properties. Climate model simulations with fixed sea surface temperatures but perturbed atmospheric aerosol loadings allow for an estimate of how strongly the planet's radiative energy budget has been perturbed by the increase in aerosols since pre-industrial times. The approximate partial radiative perturbation (APRP) technique further decomposes the contributions to the direct forcing due to aerosol scattering and absorption and to the indirect forcing due to aerosol-induced changes in cloud scattering, amount, and absorption, as well as the effects of aerosols on surface albedo. Here we evaluate previously published APRP-derived estimates of aerosol effective radiative forcings from these simulations conducted in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and find that they are biased as a result of two large coding errors that – in most cases – fortuitously compensate. The most notable exception is the direct radiative forcing from absorbing aerosols, which is more than 40 \% larger averaged across CMIP6 models in the present study. Correcting these biases eliminates the residuals and leads to better agreement with benchmark estimates derived from double calls to the radiation code. The APRP method – when properly implemented – remains a highly accurate and efficient technique for diagnosing aerosol ERF in cases where double radiation calls are not available, and in all cases it provides quantification of the individual contributors to the ERF that are highly useful but not otherwise available.},

Using this framework, the sensitivity of the stationary ABL to the large-scale boundary conditions [underlying sea surface temperature (SST) and overlying humidity and temperature in the free troposphere] is investigated in large-eddy simulations (LESs). For increasing SST or decreasing free-tropospheric temperature, the LES exhibits a transition from a cloud-free, well-mixed ABL stationary state, through a cloudy, well-mixed stationary state and a stable shallow cumulus stationary state, to an unstable regime with a deepening shallow cumulus layer. For a warm SST, when increasing free-tropospheric humidity, the LES exhibits a transition from a stable shallow cumulus stationary state, through a stable cumulus-under-stratus stationary state, to an unstable regime with a deepening, cumulus-under-stratus layer. For a cool SST, when increasing the free-tropospheric humidity, the LES stationary state exhibits a transition from a cloud-free, well-mixed ABL regime, through a well-mixed cumulus-capped regime, to a stratus-capped regime with a decoupling between the subcloud and cloud layers. This dataset can be used to evaluate other ABL models. As an example, the sensitivity of a bulk model based on the mixing-line model is presented. This bulk model reproduces the LES sensitivity to SST and free-tropospheric temperature for the stable and unstable shallow cumulus regimes, but it is less successful at reproducing the LES sensitivity to free-tropospheric humidity for both shallow cumulus and well-mixed regimes.},

The approach combines the Richards equation and the van Genuchten–Mualem soil models, with initial and boundary conditions provided by geophysical and meteorological measurements, into a Bayesian formalism, which allows integration between different complementary information sources. A major challenge in such studies is the integration between different types of data, of different quality and resolution, and with prior information. Accurate modeling of prior information is challenging because of the need to avoid subjective judgment with regard to the quality of the prior information and its significance. To obtain minimally subjective prior probabilities required for the Bayesian approach, we employ the principle of minimum relative entropy (MRE). It can often be the case that information that is considered a suitable prior may, in fact, become incompatible with field observations as more observations become available. Our study considers this possibility and explores possible indications for prior incompatibility. We test our forward and inverse modeling approaches using field data. The results indicate that our approach is consistent, in the sense that as additional data are introduced, the simulated soil moisture content profile better matches the observed profile and the predictive intervals become much narrower. The narrower intervals of the soil moisture predictions indicate the reduction of uncertainties associated with the model parameters.},

The goal of this paper is to explain in detail the mechanisms by which precipitation increase is constrained by radiative cooling. Changes in clear-sky atmospheric radiative cooling resulting from changes in temperature and humidity in global warming simulations are in good agreement with the multimodel, global-mean precipitation increase projected by GCMs ({\textasciitilde}1.1 W m−2 K−1). In an atmosphere with fixed specific humidity, radiative cooling from the top of the atmosphere (TOA) increases in response to a uniform temperature increase of the surface and atmosphere, while atmospheric cooling by exchange with the surface decreases because the upward emission of longwave radiation from the surface increases more than the downward longwave radiation from the atmosphere. When a fixed relative humidity (RH) assumption is made, however, uniform warming causes a much smaller increase of cooling at the TOA, and the surface contribution reverses to an increase in net cooling rate due to increased downward emission from water vapor. Sensitivity of precipitation changes to lapse rate changes is modest when RH is fixed. Carbon dioxide reduces TOA emission with only weak effects on surface fluxes, and thus suppresses precipitation. The net atmospheric cooling response and thereby the precipitation response to CO2-induced warming at fixed RH are mostly contributed by changes in surface fluxes. The role of clouds is discussed. Intermodel spread in the rate of precipitation increase across the CMIP5 simulations is attributed to differences in the atmospheric cooling.},

State-of-the-art Earth system models can provide detailed insight into these impacts, but have a large associated computational cost on a per-scenario basis. This large computational burden has driven recent interest in developing cheap machine learning models for the task of climate model emulation. In this manuscript, we explore the efficacy of randomly wired neural networks for this task. We describe how they can be constructed and compare them to their standard feedforward counterparts using the ClimateBench dataset. Specifically, we replace the serially connected dense layers in multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and convolutional long short-term memory networks with randomly wired dense layers and assess the impact on model performance for models with 1 million and 10 million parameters. We find that models with less complex architectures see the greatest performance improvement with the addition of random wiring (up to 30.4\% for multilayer perceptrons). Furthermore, out of 24 different model architecture, parameter count, and prediction task combinations, only one saw a statistically significant performance deficit in randomly wired networks compared to their standard counterparts, with 14 cases showing statistically significant improvement. We also find no significant difference in prediction speed between networks with standard feedforward dense layers and those with randomly wired layers. These findings indicate that randomly wired neural networks may be suitable direct replacements for traditional dense layers in many standard models.},

Clouds remain a major uncertainty in estimates of climate sensitivity. Using their recently developed methods for removing spurious artefacts from historic satellite cloud records, Joel Norris et al. have constructed a record of the global pattern of cloud changes between the 1980s and the 2000s. The changes in cloud distribution in the reprocessed satellite observations are similar to those predicted by models of climate with recent external radiative forcing. The models and observations show that, over the past few decades, storm tracks have moved poleward and the subtropical dry zones have expanded. Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and post-volcanic recovery are the most likely explanations for the changes in clouds. Clouds substantially affect Earth’s energy budget by reflecting solar radiation back to space and by restricting emission of thermal radiation to space1. They are perhaps the largest uncertainty in our understanding of climate change, owing to disagreement among climate models and observational datasets over what cloud changes have occurred during recent decades and will occur in response to global warming2,3. This is because observational systems originally designed for monitoring weather have lacked sufficient stability to detect cloud changes reliably over decades unless they have been corrected to remove artefacts4,5. Here we show that several independent, empirically corrected satellite records exhibit large-scale patterns of cloud change between the 1980s and the 2000s that are similar to those produced by model simulations of climate with recent historical external radiative forcing. Observed and simulated cloud change patterns are consistent with poleward retreat of mid-latitude storm tracks, expansion of subtropical dry zones, and increasing height of the highest cloud tops at all latitudes. The primary drivers of these cloud changes appear to be increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and a recovery from volcanic radiative cooling. These results indicate that the cloud changes most consistently predicted by global climate models are currently occurring in nature.},

	abstract = {A fundamental limitation of grid-based models is their inability to resolve variability on scales smaller than a grid box. Past research has shown that significant aerosol variability exists on scales smaller than these grid boxes, which can lead to discrepancies in simulated aerosol climate effects between high- and low-resolution models. This study investigates the impact of neglecting subgrid variability in present-day global microphysical aerosol models on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). We introduce a novel technique to isolate the effect of aerosol variability from other sources of model variability by varying the resolution of aerosol and trace gas fields while maintaining a constant resolution in the rest of the model. We compare WRF-Chem (Weather and Research Forecast model) runs in which aerosol and gases are simulated at 80 km and again at 10 km resolutions; in both simulations the other model components, such as meteorology and dynamics, are kept at the 10 km baseline resolution. We find that AOD is underestimated by 13 \% and CCN is overestimated by 27 \% when aerosol and gases are simulated at 80 km resolution compared to 10 km. The processes most affected by neglecting aerosol subgrid variability are gas-phase chemistry and aerosol uptake of water through aerosol–gas equilibrium reactions. The inherent non-linearities in these processes result in large changes in aerosol properties when aerosol and gaseous species are artificially mixed over large spatial scales. These changes in aerosol and gas concentrations are exaggerated by convective transport, which transports these altered concentrations to altitudes where their effect is more pronounced. These results demonstrate that aerosol variability can have a large impact on simulating aerosol climate effects, even when meteorology and dynamics are held constant. Future aerosol model development should focus on accounting for the effect of subgrid variability on these processes at global scales in order to improve model predictions of the aerosol effect on climate.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations described in previous studies showed that adding cloud condensation nuclei to marine stratocumulus can prevent their breakup from closed into open cells. Additional analyses of the same simulations show that the suppression of rain is well described in terms of cloud drop effective radius (re). Rain is initiated when re near cloud top is around 12–14 μm. Cloud water starts to get depleted when column‐maximum rain intensity (Rmax) exceeds 0.1 mm h−1. This happens when cloud‐top re reaches 14 μm. Rmax is mostly less than 0.1 mm h−1 at re {\textless} 14 μm, regardless of the cloud water path, but increases rapidly when re exceeds 14 μm. This is in agreement with recent aircraft observations and theoretical studies in convective clouds so that the mechanism is not limited to describing marine stratocumulus. These results support the hypothesis that the onset of significant precipitation is determined by the number of nucleated cloud drops and the depth (D) above cloud base within the cloud that is required for cloud drops to reach re of 14 μm. In turn, this can explain the conditions for initiation of significant drizzle and opening of closed cells providing the basis for a simple parameterization for GCMs that unifies the representation of both precipitating and non‐precipitating clouds as well as the transition between them. Furthermore, satellite global observations of cloud depth (from base to top), and cloud‐top re can be used to derive and validate this parameterization. Numerical simulations show how aerosols and cloud depth control rain initiation Rain is iniated when drops r‐eff reach 14 \{mu\}m regardless of cloud water path This can explain the control of aerosols on change between closed and open cells},

	abstract = {The primary driver of the climate system is the uneven distribution of incoming and outgoing radiation on earth. The incoming radiant energy is transformed into various forms (internal heat, potential energy, latent energy, and kinetic energy), moved around in various ways primarily by the atmosphere and oceans, stored and sequestered in the ocean, land, and ice components of the climate system, and ultimately radiated back to space as infrared radiation. The requirement for an equilibrium climate mandates a balance between the incoming and outgoing radiation, and further mandates that the flows of energy are systematic. These drive the weather systems in the atmosphere, currents in the ocean, and fundamentally determine the climate. Values are provided for the seasonal uptake and release of heat by the oceans that substantially moderate the climate in maritime regions. In the atmosphere, the poleward transports are brought about mainly by large-scale overturning, including the Hadley circulation in low latitudes, and baroclinic storms in the extratropics, but the seamless nature of the transports on about monthly time-scales indicates a fundamental link between the two rather different mechanisms. The flows of energy can be perturbed, causing climate change. This article provides an overview of the flows of energy, its transformations, transports, uptake, storage and release, and the processes involved. The focus is on the region 60°N to 60°S, and results are presented for the solstitial seasons and their differences to highlight the annual cycle. Challenges in better determining the surface heat balance and its changes with time are discussed. Copyright © 2004 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {The recent IPCC reports state that continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, threatening “severe, pervasive and irreversible” impacts. Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention – deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2 ∘C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5 ∘C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate “reversibility”, the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.},

	abstract = {The Max-Planck-Institute Aerosol Climatology version 1 (MAC-v1) is introduced. It describes the optical properties of tropospheric aerosols on monthly timescales and with global coverage at a spatial resolution of 1° in latitude and longitude. By providing aerosol radiative properties for any wavelength of the solar (or shortwave) and of the terrestrial (or longwave) radiation spectrum, as needed in radiative transfer applications, this MAC-v1 data set lends itself to simplified and computationally efficient representations of tropospheric aerosol in climate studies. Estimates of aerosol radiative properties are provided for both total and anthropogenic aerosol in annual time steps from preindustrial times (i.e., starting with year 1860) well into the future (until the year 2100). Central to the aerosol climatology is the merging of monthly statistics of aerosol optical properties for current (year 2000) conditions. Hereby locally sparse but trusted high-quality data by ground-based sun-photometer networks are merged onto complete background maps defined by central data from global modeling with complex aerosol modules. This merging yields 0.13 for the global annual midvisible aerosol optical depth (AOD), with 0.07 attributed to aerosol sizes larger than 1 µm in diameter and 0.06 of attributed to aerosol sizes smaller than 1 µm in diameter. Hereby larger particles are less absorbing with a single scattering albedo (SSA) of 0.98 compared to 0.93 for smaller sizes. Simulation results of a global model are applied to prescribe the vertical distribution and to estimate anthropogenic contributions to the smaller size AOD as a function of time, with a 0.037 value for current conditions. In a demonstration application, the associated aerosol direct radiative effects are determined. For current conditions, total aerosol is estimated to reduce the combined shortwave and longwave net-flux balance at the top of the atmosphere by about −1.6 W/m2 from which −0.5 W/m2 (with an uncertainty of ±0.2 W/m2) is attributed to anthropogenic activities. Based on past and projected aerosol emission data, the global anthropogenic direct aerosol impact (i.e., ToA cooling) is currently near the maximum and is projected to drop by 2100 to about −0.3 W/m2. The reported global averages are driven by considerable spatial and temporal variability. To better convey this diversity, regional and seasonal distributions of aerosol optical properties and their radiative effects are presented. On regional scales, the anthropogenic direct aerosol forcing can be an order of magnitude stronger than the global average and it can be of either sign. It is also shown that maximum anthropogenic impacts have shifted during the last 30 years from the U.S. and Europe to eastern and southern Asia.},

Pattern scaling is a useful approach to approximate mean changes in climate model projections, and we extend this methodology to build a climate model emulator that also accounts for variability of temperature projections at the seasonal scale. Using 30 runs from the NCAR/DOE CESM1 large initial condition ensemble for RCP8.5 from 2006 to 2080, we fit a pattern scaling model to grid-specific seasonal average temperature change. We then use this fitted model to emulate seasonal average temperature change for the RCP4.5 scenario based on its global average temperature trend. By using a linear mixed-effects model and carefully resampling the residuals from the RCP8.5 model, we emulate the variability of RCP4.5 and allow the variability to depend on global average temperature. Specifically, we emulate both the internal variability affecting the long-term trends across initial condition ensemble members, and the variability superimposed on the long-term trend within individual ensemble members. The 15 initial condition ensemble members available for RCP4.5 from the same climate model are then used to validate the emulator. We view this approach as a step forward in providing relevant climate information for avoided impacts studies, and more broadly for impact models, since we allow both forced changes and internal variability to play a role in determining future impact risks.},

A complementary approach to large initial condition ensembles is to train a stochastic generator on fewer runs. While simulations from a statistical model cannot capture the complexity of climate model runs, they can address some specific scientific questions of interest, such as sampling the variability of regional trends. We demonstrate this potential by comparing simulations from a large ensemble and a stochastic generator trained with only four runs, and show that the variability of regional temperature trends is almost indistinguishable. Training stochastic generators on fewer runs might prove especially useful in the context of large climate model inter-comparison projects where creating large ensembles for each model is not possible.},

Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise.

The re-analysis assimilates total aerosol optical depth retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to correct for model departures from observed aerosols. The re-analysis therefore combines satellite retrievals with the full spatial coverage of a numerical model. Re-analysed products are used here to estimate the shortwave direct and first indirect radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols over the period 2003–2010, using methods previously applied to satellite retrievals of aerosols and clouds. The best estimate of globally-averaged, all-sky direct radiative forcing is −0.7 ± 0.3 Wm−2. The standard deviation is obtained by a Monte-Carlo analysis of uncertainties, which accounts for uncertainties in the aerosol anthropogenic fraction, aerosol absorption, and cloudy-sky effects. Further accounting for differences between the present-day natural and pre-industrial aerosols provides a direct radiative forcing estimate of −0.4 ± 0.3 Wm−2. The best estimate of globally-averaged, all-sky first indirect radiative forcing is −0.6 ± 0.4 Wm−2. Its standard deviation accounts for uncertainties in the aerosol anthropogenic fraction, and in cloud albedo and cloud droplet number concentration susceptibilities to aerosol changes. The distribution of first indirect radiative forcing is asymmetric and is bounded by −0.1 and −2.0 Wm−2. In order to decrease uncertainty ranges, better observational constraints on aerosol absorption and sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentrations to aerosol changes are required.},

We present an observed climatology of cloud albedo susceptibility to cloud droplet number concentration perturbations (S0) with changing sea surface temperature (SST) and estimated inversion strength for single‐layer warm clouds over the North Atlantic Ocean, using eight years of satellite and reanalysis data. The key findings are that SST has a dominant control on S0 in the presence of co‐varying synoptic conditions and aerosol perturbations. Cloud brightening in regions with positive S0 weakens with increasing local SST. Higher SST significantly hastens cloud‐top evaporation with increasing aerosol loading, by accelerating entrainment and facilitating entrainment drying. In a global‐warming‐like scenario where aerosol loading is reduced, more cloud brightening is expected, mainly as a result of reduced entrainment drying. Our results imply a less positive low‐cloud liquid water path feedback in a warmer climate with decreasing aerosol loading. Low clouds over the ocean are a poorly quantified component of the climate system. Here we use eight years of space‐based measurements and meteorological data to quantify how the brightness of single‐layer low clouds over the North Atlantic Ocean might respond to cloud droplet number concentration perturbations in a warmer world. We find that under higher sea surface temperatures, increases in drop number tend to reduce cloud brightness by accelerating evaporation of cloud water. Thus in a warmer world, low clouds will reflect less energy to space in response to an increase in aerosol loading. If aerosol sources decrease then we expect more robust clouds and more offsetting of greenhouse gas warming.

	abstract = {Ensemble prediction systems typically show positive spread-error correlation, but they are subject to forecast bias and dispersion errors, and are therefore uncalibrated. This work proposes the use of ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), an easy-to-implement postprocessing technique that addresses both forecast bias and underdispersion and takes into account the spread-skill relationship. The technique is based on multiple linear regression and is akin to the superensemble approach that has traditionally been used for deterministic-style forecasts. The EMOS technique yields probabilistic forecasts that take the form of Gaussian predictive probability density functions (PDFs) for continuous weather variables and can be applied to gridded model output. The EMOS predictive mean is a bias-corrected weighted average of the ensemble member forecasts, with coefficients that can be interpreted in terms of the relative contributions of the member models to the ensemble, and provides a highly competitive deterministic-style forecast. The EMOS predictive variance is a linear function of the ensemble variance. For fitting the EMOS coefficients, the method of minimum continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) estimation is introduced. This technique finds the coefficient values that optimize the CRPS for the training data. The EMOS technique was applied to 48-h forecasts of sea level pressure and surface temperature over the North American Pacific Northwest in spring 2000, using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble. When compared to the bias-corrected ensemble, deterministic-style EMOS forecasts of sea level pressure had root-mean-square error 9\% less and mean absolute error 7\% less. The EMOS predictive PDFs were sharp, and much better calibrated than the raw ensemble or the bias-corrected ensemble.},

We used a dataset of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) observations from 34 different surface locations to evaluate the GLOMAP global chemical transport model. The standard model simulation (which included SOA from monoterpenes only) underpredicted organic aerosol (OA) observed by the AMS and had little skill reproducing the variability in the dataset. We simulated SOA formation from biogenic (monoterpenes and isoprene), lumped anthropogenic and lumped biomass burning volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and varied the SOA yield from each precursor source to produce the best overall match between model and observations. We assumed that SOA is essentially non-volatile and condenses irreversibly onto existing aerosol. Our best estimate of the SOA source is 140 Tg (SOA) a$^{\textrm{−1}}$ but with a large uncertainty range which we estimate to be 50–380 Tg (SOA) a$^{\textrm{−1}}$. We found the minimum in normalised mean error (NME) between model and the AMS dataset when we assumed a large SOA source (100 Tg (SOA) a$^{\textrm{−1}}$) from sources that spatially matched anthropogenic pollution (which we term antropogenically controlled SOA). We used organic carbon observations compiled by Bahadur et al. (2009) to evaluate our estimated SOA sources. We found that the model with a large anthropogenic SOA source was the most consistent with these observations, however improvement over the model with a large biogenic SOA source (250 Tg (SOA) a$^{\textrm{−1}}$) was small. We used a dataset of $^{\textrm{14}}$C observations from rural locations to evaluate our estimated SOA sources. We estimated a maximum of 10 Tg (SOA) a$^{\textrm{−1}}$ (10 \%) of the anthropogenically controlled SOA source could be from fossil (urban/industrial) sources. We suggest that an additional anthropogenic source is most likely due to an anthropogenic pollution enhancement of SOA formation from biogenic VOCs. Such an anthropogenically controlled SOA source would result in substantial climate forcing. We estimated a global mean aerosol direct effect of −0.26 \&amp;plusmn; 0.15 Wm$^{\textrm{\&amp;minus;2}}$ and indirect (cloud albedo) effect of \&amp;minus;0.6$^{\textrm{+0.24}}$$_{\textrm{\&amp;minus;0.14}}$ Wm$^{\textrm{−2}}$ from anthropogenically controlled SOA. The biogenic and biomass SOA sources are not well constrained with this analysis due to the limited number of OA observations in regions and periods strongly impacted by these sources. To further improve the constraints by this method, additional OA observations are needed in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract In variational formulations of data assimilation, the estimation of parameters or initial state values by a search for a minimum of a cost function can be hindered by the numerous local minima in the dependence of the cost function on those quantities. We argue that this is a result of instability on the synchronization manifold where the observations are required to match the model outputs in the situation where the data and the model are chaotic. The solution to this impediment to estimation is given as controls moving the positive conditional Lyapunov exponents on the synchronization manifold to negative values and adding to the cost function a penalty that drives those controls to zero as a result of the optimization process implementing the assimilation. This is seen as the solution to the proper size of ‘nudging’ terms: they are zero once the estimation has been completed, leaving only the physics of the problem to govern forecasts after the assimilation window. We show how this procedure, called Dynamical State and Parameter Estimation (DSPE), works in the case of the Lorenz96 model with nine dynamical variables. Using DSPE, we are able to accurately estimate the fixed parameter of this model and all of the state variables, observed and unobserved, over an assimilation time interval [0, T ]. Using the state variables at T and the estimated fixed parameter, we are able to accurately forecast the state of the model for t {\textgreater} T to those times where the chaotic behaviour of the system interferes with forecast accuracy.

The diversity of the global OA simulation results has increased since earlier AeroCom experiments, mainly due to the increasing complexity of the SOA parameterization in models, and the implementation of new, highly uncertain, OA sources. Diversity of over one order of magnitude exists in the modeled vertical distribution of OA concentrations that deserves a dedicated future study. Furthermore, although the OA / OC ratio depends on OA sources and atmospheric processing, and is important for model evaluation against OA and OC observations, it is resolved only by a few global models. The median global primary OA (POA) source strength is 56 Tg a−1 (range 34–144 Tg a−1) and the median SOA source strength (natural and anthropogenic) is 19 Tg a−1 (range 13–121 Tg a−1). Among the models that take into account the semi-volatile SOA nature, the median source is calculated to be 51 Tg a−1 (range 16–121 Tg a−1), much larger than the median value of the models that calculate SOA in a more simplistic way (19 Tg a−1; range 13–20 Tg a−1, with one model at 37 Tg a−1). The median atmospheric burden of OA is 1.4 Tg (24 models in the range of 0.6–2.0 Tg and 4 between 2.0 and 3.8 Tg), with a median OA lifetime of 5.4 days (range 3.8–9.6 days). In models that reported both OA and sulfate burdens, the median value of the OA/sulfate burden ratio is calculated to be 0.77; 13 models calculate a ratio lower than 1, and 9 models higher than 1. For 26 models that reported OA deposition fluxes, the median wet removal is 70 Tg a−1 (range 28–209 Tg a−1), which is on average 85\% of the total OA deposition. Fine aerosol organic carbon (OC) and OA observations from continuous monitoring networks and individual field campaigns have been used for model evaluation. At urban locations, the model–observation comparison indicates missing knowledge on anthropogenic OA sources, both strength and seasonality. The combined model–measurements analysis suggests the existence of increased OA levels during summer due to biogenic SOA formation over large areas of the USA that can be of the same order of magnitude as the POA, even at urban locations, and contribute to the measured urban seasonal pattern. Global models are able to simulate the high secondary character of OA observed in the atmosphere as a result of SOA formation and POA aging, although the amount of OA present in the atmosphere remains largely underestimated, with a mean normalized bias (MNB) equal to −0.62 (−0.51) based on the comparison against OC (OA) urban data of all models at the surface, −0.15 (+0.51) when compared with remote measurements, and −0.30 for marine locations with OC data. The mean temporal correlations across all stations are low when compared with OC (OA) measurements: 0.47 (0.52) for urban stations, 0.39 (0.37) for remote stations, and 0.25 for marine stations with OC data. The combination of high (negative) MNB and higher correlation at urban stations when compared with the low MNB and lower correlation at remote sites suggests that knowledge about the processes that govern aerosol processing, transport and removal, on top of their sources, is important at the remote stations. There is no clear change in model skill with increasing model complexity with regard to OC or OA mass concentration. However, the complexity is needed in models in order to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural OA as needed for climate mitigation, and to calculate the impact of OA on climate accurately.},

	abstract = {The amount of solar (shortwave) radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface underwent substantial variations over recent decades. Since the 1950s, surface shortwave radiation gradually decreased at widespread locations. In Europe, this so-called surface dimming continued until the late 1980s, when surface brightening set in and surface shortwave radiation increased again. In China, the dimming levelled off in the 1980s, but did not turn into brightening until 2005. Changes in clouds and aerosol are the prime potential causes for the phenomenon, but the scientific community has not yet reached a consensus about the relative role of the different potential forcing agents. Here we bring together co-located long-term observational data from surface and space to study decadal changes of the shortwave energy balance in Europe and China from 1985 to 2015. Within this observation-based framework, we show that an increasing net shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere and a decreasing atmospheric shortwave absorption each contribute roughly half of the observed brightening trends in Europe. For China, we find that the continued dimming until 2005 and the subsequent brightening occurred despite opposing trends in the top-of-the-atmosphere net shortwave radiation. This shows that changes in atmospheric shortwave absorption are a major driver of European brightening and the dominant cause for the Chinese surface trends. Although the observed variations cannot be attributed unambiguously, we discuss potential causes for the observed changes. Changes in the atmospheric absorption of shortwave radiation, probably through cloud and aerosol effects, is the main reason for the dimming and brightening over China and Europe in past decades, according to co-located surface and space observations.},

	abstract = {A highly uncertain aspect of anthropogenic climate change is the rate at which the global hydrologic cycle intensifies. The future change in global‐mean precipitation per degree warming, or hydrologic sensitivity, exhibits a threefold spread (1–3\%/K) in current global climate models. In this study, we find that the intermodel spread in this value is associated with a significant portion of variability in future projections of extreme precipitation in the tropics, extending also into subtropical atmospheric river corridors. Additionally, there is a very tight intermodel relationship between changes in extreme and nonextreme precipitation, whereby models compensate for increasing extreme precipitation events by decreasing weak‐moderate events. Another factor linked to changes in precipitation extremes is model resolution, with higher resolution models showing a larger increase in heavy extremes. These results highlight ways various aspects of hydrologic cycle intensification are linked in models and shed new light on the task of constraining precipitation extremes. The global water cycle is expected to intensify under climate change and can be generally characterized by greater rainfall and surface evaporation in the future. However, the rate at which the globally averaged precipitation increases is highly variable among different climate models. In this paper, we relate the intermodel variability in global water cycle intensification to differences in model projections of heavy precipitation in tropical and some extratropical regions. We also find that models consistently experience a trade‐off between increasing heavy and decreasing light‐moderate precipitation: Models with larger future increases in heavy precipitation exhibit greater compensating declines in light‐moderate rainfall. Differences in heavy precipitation changes are also tied to model resolution. Our study helps to provide new insight on the factors shaping projections of future precipitation extremes, which have strong implications for water resources, natural hazard risks associated with flooding, and ecosystem stability. Models with higher global hydrologic sensitivity project larger extreme precipitation increases in tropical and some extratropical regions Models with a larger increase in extreme precipitation exhibit compensating larger declines or smaller increases in light‐moderate events The results showcase links between hydrologic cycle projections across spatial scales and offer new perspectives for constraining extremes},

It is designed to be flexible enough to represent a variety of cloudiness regimes—such as cumulus, stratocumulus, and clear regimes—without the need for case-specific adjustments. The methodology behind the model is the so-called assumed probability density function (PDF) method. The parameterization differs from higher-order closure or mass-flux schemes in that it achieves closure by the use of a relatively sophisticated joint PDF of vertical velocity, temperature, and moisture. A family of PDFs is chosen that is flexible enough to represent various cloudiness regimes. A double Gaussian family proposed by previous works is used. Predictive equations for grid box means and a number of higher-order turbulent moments are advanced in time. These moments are in turn used to select a particular member from the family of PDFs, for each time step and grid box. Once a PDF member has been selected, the scheme integrates over the PDF to close higher-order moments, buoyancy terms, and diagnose cloud fraction and liquid water. Since all the diagnosed moments for a given grid box and time step are derived from the same unique joint PDF, they are guaranteed to be consistent with one another.

	abstract = {Earth system models (ESMs) are state-of-the-art climate models that allow numerical simulations of the past, present-day, and future climate. To extend our understanding of the Earth system and improve climate change projections, the complexity of ESMs heavily increased over the last decades. As a consequence, the amount and volume of data provided by ESMs has increased considerably. Innovative tools for a comprehensive model evaluation and analysis are required to assess the performance of these increasingly complex ESMs against observations or reanalyses. One of these tools is the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community diagnostic and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of ESMs. Input data for ESMValTool need to be formatted according to the CMOR (Climate Model Output Rewriter) standard, a process that is usually referred to as CMORization. While this is a quasi-standard for large model intercomparison projects like the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), this complicates the application of ESMValTool to non-CMOR-compliant climate model output. In this paper, we describe an extension of ESMValTool introduced in v2.6.0 that allows seamless reading and processing native climate model output, i.e., raw output directly produced by the climate model. This is achieved by an extension of ESMValTool's preprocessing pipeline that performs a CMOR-like reformatting of the native model output during runtime. Thus, the rich collection of diagnostics provided by ESMValTool is now fully available for these models. For models that use unstructured grids, a further preprocessing step required to apply many common diagnostics is regridding to a regular latitude-longitude grid. Extensions to ESMValTool's regridding functions described here allow for more flexible interpolation schemes that can be used on unstructured grids. Currently, ESMValTool supports nearest-neighbor, bilinear, and first-order conservative regridding from unstructured grids to regular grids. Example applications of this new native model support are the evaluation of new model setups against predecessor versions, assessing of the performance of different simulations against observations, CMORization of native model data for contributions to model intercomparison projects, and monitoring of running climate model simulations. For the latter, new general-purpose diagnostics have been added to ESMValTool that are able to plot a wide range of variable types. Currently, five climate models are supported: CESM2 (experimental; will be fully available in ESMValTool v2.7.0), EC-Earth3, EMAC, ICON, and IPSL-CM6. As the framework for the CMOR-like reformatting of native model output described here is implemented in a general way, support for other climate models can be easily added.},

	abstract = {Tropical convection is expected to decrease with warming, in a variety of ways. Specific incarnations of this idea include the “stability‐iris” hypothesis of decreasing anvil cloud coverage, as well as the decrease of both tropospheric and cloud‐base mass fluxes with warming. This paper seeks to encapsulate these phenomena into three “rules,” and to explore their interrelationships and robustness, using both analytical reasoning as well as cloud‐resolving and global climate simulations. We find that each of these rules can be derived analytically from the usual expression for clear‐sky subsidence, so they all embody the same essential physics. But, these rules do not all provide the same degree of constraint: the stability‐iris effect is not entirely robust due to unconstrained microphysical degrees of freedom, and the decrease in cloud‐base mass flux is not entirely robust due to unconstrained effects of entrainment and detrainment. Tropospheric mass fluxes on the other hand are shown to be well‐constrained theoretically, and when evaluated in temperature coordinates they exhibit a monotonic decrease with warming at all vertical levels and across a hierarchy of models. Tropical convection and high cloudiness are expected to decrease with global warming, in a variety of ways. This phenomenon has a few different manifestations in the literature, whose relationships are unclear. We show analytically that these explanations all embody the same essential physics, but are not equally robust and thus do not all have the same predictive power. Three constraints on tropical convection can all be derived analytically from clear‐sky subsidence Tropospheric mass fluxes at a fixed isotherm should robustly decrease under global warming Decreases in anvil cloud area and cloud‐base mass flux are not as robust Three constraints on tropical convection can all be derived analytically from clear‐sky subsidence Tropospheric mass fluxes at a fixed isotherm should robustly decrease under global warming Decreases in anvil cloud area and cloud‐base mass flux are not as robust},

Yet these effects could be very significant, as persistent increases in global mean temperatures may ultimately influence the large-scale processes in the coupled ocean–atmosphere system that are thought to play a central part in determining global climate. The thermohaline circulation is one such process—Broecker has argued11 that it may have undergone abrupt changes in response to rising temperatures and ice-sheet melting at the end of the last glacial period. Here we use a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model to study the evolution of the world's climate over the next few centuries, driven by doubling and quadrupling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2. We find that the global mean surface air temperature increases by about 3.5 and 7 °C, respectively, over 500 years, and that sea-level rise owing to thermal expansion alone is about 1 and 2 m respectively (ice-sheet melting could make these values much larger). The thermal and dynamical structure of the oceans changes markedly in the quadrupled-CO2 climate—in particular, the ocean settles into a new stable state in which the thermohaline circulation has ceased entirely and the thermocline deepens substantially. These changes prevent the ventilation of the deep ocean and could have a profound impact on the carbon cycle and biogeochemistry of the coupled system.},

However, we also show that previously proposed mechanisms are unable to explain the invigoration. Examining underlying processes reveals that, in our simulations, high aerosol concentrations increase environmental humidity by producing clouds that mix more condensed water into the surrounding air. In turn, higher humidity favors large-scale ascent and stronger convection. Our results provide a physical reason to expect invigorated thunderstorms in high-aerosol regions of the tropics.},

It is shown that the near term warming projected under RCP2.6 is greater than under RCP4.5, even though the greenhouse gas forcing is lower. Rapid and substantial reductions in sulphate aerosol emissions due to a reduction of coal burning in RCP2.6 lead to a reduction in the negative shortwave forcing due to aerosol direct and indirect effects. Indirect effects play an important role over the northern hemisphere oceans, especially the subtropical northeastern Pacific where an anomaly of 5–10 Wm−2 develops. The pattern of surface temperature change is consistent with the expected response to this surface radiation anomaly, whilst also exhibiting features that reflect redistribution of energy, and feedbacks, within the climate system.

Studies have indicated that model estimates of cloud susceptibility to aerosols frequently exceed satellite estimates, motivating model reformulations to increase agreement. Here we show that conventional ways of using satellite information to estimate susceptibility can serve as only a weak constraint on models because the estimation is sensitive to errors in the retrieval procedures. Using instrument simulators to investigate differences between model and satellite estimates of susceptibilities, we find that low aerosol loading conditions are not well characterized by satellites, but model clouds are sensitive to aerosol perturbations in these conditions. We quantify the observational requirements needed to constrain models, and find that the nighttime lidar measurements of aerosols provide a better characterization of tenuous aerosols. We conclude that observational uncertainties and limitations need to be accounted for when assessing the role of aerosols in the climate system. Cloud susceptibility to aerosols in models frequently exceeds satellite estimates. Here the authors show that the discrepancy can be explained by retrieval limitations especially in clean environments, suggesting that conventional comparison strategies may lead to misunderstanding.},

	abstract = {Aerosols affect the climate system by changing cloud characteristics in many ways. They act as cloud condensation and ice nuclei and may have an influence on the hydrological cycle. Here we investigate aerosol effects on convective clouds by extending the double-moment cloud microphysics scheme developed for stratiform clouds, which is coupled to the HAM double-moment aerosol scheme, to convective clouds in the ECHAM5 general circulation model. This enables us to investigate whether more, and smaller cloud droplets suppress the warm rain formation in the lower parts of convective clouds and thus release more latent heat upon freezing, which would then result in more vigorous convection and more precipitation. In ECHAM5, including aerosol effects in large-scale and convective clouds (simulation ECHAM5-conv) reduces the sensitivity of the liquid water path increase with increasing aerosol optical depth in better agreement with observations and large-eddy simulation studies. In simulation ECHAM5-conv with increases in greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions since pre-industrial times, the geographical distribution of the changes in precipitation better matches the observed increase in precipitation than neglecting microphysics in convective clouds. In this simulation the convective precipitation increases the most suggesting that the convection has indeed become more vigorous.},

Vertically resolved ozone datasets are typically constructed from multiple satellite, sonde and ground-based measurements that do not provide continuous coverage. As a result, several methods have been used to infill these gaps, most commonly relying on regression against observed time series. However, these existing methods either provide low accuracy infilling especially over polar regions, unphysical extrapolation, or an incomplete estimation of uncertainty. To address these methodological shortcomings we used and further developed an infilling framework that fuses observations with output from an ensemble of chemistry-climate models within a Bayesian neural network. We used this deep learning framework to produce a continuous record of vertically resolved ozone with uncertainty estimates. Under rigorous testing the infilling framework extrapolated and interpolated skillfully and maintained realistic interannual variability due to the inclusion of physically and chemically realistic models. This framework and the ozone dataset it produced, enables a more thorough investigation of vertically resolved trends throughout the atmosphere.},

Current models use grid spacings of ∼ 200 km, while satellite observations of aerosol use so-called pixels of ∼ 10 km. Ground site or airborne observations relate to even smaller spatial scales. We study the errors incurred due to different resolutions by aggregating high-resolution simulations (10 km grid spacing) over either the large areas of global model grid boxes ("perfect" model data) or small areas corresponding to the pixels of satellite measurements or the field of view of ground sites ("perfect" observations). Our analysis suggests that instantaneous root-mean-square (RMS) differences of perfect observations from perfect global models can easily amount to 30–160 \%, for a range of observables like AOT (aerosol optical thickness), extinction, black carbon mass concentrations, PM2.5, number densities and CCN (cloud condensation nuclei). These differences, due entirely to different spatial sampling of models and observations, are often larger than measurement errors in real observations. Temporal averaging over a month of data reduces these differences more strongly for some observables (e.g. a threefold reduction for AOT), than for others (e.g. a twofold reduction for surface black carbon concentrations), but significant RMS differences remain (10–75 \%). Note that this study ignores the issue of temporal sampling of real observations, which is likely to affect our present monthly error estimates. We examine several other strategies (e.g. spatial aggregation of observations, interpolation of model data) for reducing these differences and show their effectiveness. Finally, we examine consequences for the use of flight campaign data in global model evaluation and show that significant biases may be introduced depending on the flight strategy used.},

	abstract = {The south-eastern Atlantic Ocean (SEA) is semi-permanently covered by one of the most extensive stratocumulus cloud decks on the planet and experiences about one-third of the global biomass burning emissions from the southern Africa savannah region during the fire season. To get a better understanding of the impact of these biomass burning aerosols on clouds and the radiation balance over the SEA, the latest generation of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) is employed. Measurements from the CLARIFY and ORACLES flight campaigns are used to evaluate the model, demonstrating that the model has good skill in reproducing the biomass burning plume. To investigate the underlying mechanisms in detail, the effects of biomass burning aerosols on the clouds are decomposed into radiative effects (via absorption and scattering) and microphysical effects (via perturbation of cloud condensation nuclei – CCN – and cloud microphysical processes). July–August means are used to characterize aerosols, clouds, and the radiation balance during the fire season. Results show that around 65 \% of CCN at 0.2 \% supersaturation in the SEA can be attributed to biomass burning. The absorption effect of biomass burning aerosols is the most significant on clouds and radiation. Near the continent, it increases the supersaturation diagnosed by the activation scheme, while further from the continent it reduces the altitude of the supersaturation. As a result, the cloud droplet number concentration responds with a similar pattern to the absorption effect of biomass burning aerosols. The microphysical effect, however, decreases the supersaturation and increases the cloud droplet concentration over the ocean, although this change is relatively small. The liquid water path is also significantly increased over the SEA (mainly caused by the absorption effect of biomass burning aerosols) when biomass burning aerosols are above the stratocumulus cloud deck. The microphysical pathways lead to a slight increase in the liquid water path over the ocean. These changes in cloud properties indicate the significant role of biomass burning aerosols for clouds in this region. Among the effects of biomass burning aerosols on the radiation balance, the semi-direct radiative effects (rapid adjustments induced by the radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols) have a dominant cooling impact over the SEA, which offset the warming direct radiative effect (radiative forcing from biomass burning aerosol–radiation interactions) and lead to an overall net cooling radiative effect in the SEA. However, the magnitude and the sign of the semi-direct effects are sensitive to the relative location of biomass burning aerosols and clouds, reflecting the critical task of the accurate modelling of the biomass burning plume and clouds in this region.},

	abstract = {Water vapour in the atmosphere is the source of a major climate feedback mechanism and potential increases in the availability of water vapour could have important consequences for mean and extreme precipitation. Future precipitation changes further depend on how the hydrological cycle responds to different drivers of climate change, such as greenhouse gases and aerosols. Currently, neither the total anthropogenic influence on the hydrological cycle nor that from individual drivers is constrained sufficiently to make solid projections. We investigate how integrated water vapour (IWV) responds to different drivers of climate change. Results from 11 global climate models have been used, based on simulations where CO2, methane, solar irradiance, black carbon (BC), and sulfate have been perturbed separately. While the global-mean IWV is usually assumed to increase by ∼7 \% per kelvin of surface temperature change, we find that the feedback response of IWV differs somewhat between drivers. Fast responses, which include the initial radiative effect and rapid adjustments to an external forcing, amplify these differences. The resulting net changes in IWV range from 6.4±0.9 \% K-1 for sulfate to 9.8±2 \% K-1 for BC. We further calculate the relationship between global changes in IWV and precipitation, which can be characterized by quantifying changes in atmospheric water vapour lifetime. Global climate models simulate a substantial increase in the lifetime, from 8.2±0.5 to 9.9±0.7 d between 1986–2005 and 2081–2100 under a high-emission scenario, and we discuss to what extent the water vapour lifetime provides additional information compared to analysis of IWV and precipitation separately. We conclude that water vapour lifetime changes are an important indicator of changes in precipitation patterns and that BC is particularly efficient in prolonging the mean time, and therefore likely the distance, between evaporation and precipitation.},

Improving the representation of clouds is one of the key tasks towards more robust climate change projections. This study introduces a new machine-learning based framework relying on satellite observations to improve understanding of the representation of clouds and their relevant processes in climate models. The proposed method is capable of assigning distributions of established cloud types to coarse data. It facilitates a more objective evaluation of clouds in ESMs and improves the consistency of cloud process analysis. The method is built on satellite data from the MODIS instrument labelled by deep neural networks with cloud types defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), using cloud type labels from CloudSat as ground truth. The method is applicable to datasets with information about physical cloud variables comparable to MODIS satellite data and at sufficiently high temporal resolution. We apply the method to alternative satellite data from the Cloud{\textbackslash}\_cci project (ESA Climate Change Initiative), coarse-grained to typical resolutions of climate models. The resulting cloud type distributions are physically consistent and the horizontal resolutions typical of ESMs are sufficient to apply our method. We recommend outputting crucial variables required by our method for future ESM data evaluation. This will enable the use of labelled satellite data for a more systematic evaluation of clouds in climate models.},

	abstract = {Changes in atmospheric composition, such as increasing greenhouse gases, cause an initial radiative imbalance to the climate system, quantified as the instantaneous radiative forcing. This fundamental metric has not been directly observed globally and previous estimates have come from models. In part, this is because current space‐based instruments cannot distinguish the instantaneous radiative forcing from the climate’s radiative response. We apply radiative kernels to satellite observations to disentangle these components and find all‐sky instantaneous radiative forcing has increased 0.53±0.11 W/m2 from 2003 through 2018, accounting for positive trends in the total planetary radiative imbalance. This increase has been due to a combination of rising concentrations of well‐mixed greenhouse gases and recent reductions in aerosol emissions. These results highlight distinct fingerprints of anthropogenic activity in Earth’s changing energy budget, which we find observations can detect within 4 years. Climate change is a response to energy imbalances in the climate system. For example, rising greenhouse gases directly cause an initial imbalance, the radiative forcing, in the planetary radiation budget, and surface temperatures increase in response as the climate attempts to restore balance. The radiative forcing and subsequent radiative feedbacks dictate the amount of warming. While there are well‐established observational records of greenhouse gas concentrations and surface temperatures, there is not yet a global measure of the radiative forcing, in part because current satellite observations of Earth’s radiation only measure the sum total of radiation changes that occur. We use the radiative kernel technique to isolate radiative forcing from total radiative changes and find it has increased from 2003 through 2018, accounting for nearly all of the long‐term growth in the total top‐of‐atmosphere radiation imbalance during this period. We confirm that rising greenhouse gas concentrations account for most of the increases in the radiative forcing, along with reductions in reflective aerosols. This serves as direct evidence that anthropogenic activity has affected Earth’s energy budget in the recent past. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigate the potential for emergent constraints to reduce uncertainty in regional cloud feedbacks, rather than the global‐mean cloud feedback. Strong relationships are found between the monthly and interannual variability of tropical clouds, and the tropical net cloud feedback. These relationships are combined with observations to substantially narrow the uncertainty in the tropical cloud feedback and demonstrate that the tropical cloud feedback is likely {\textgreater}0Wm−2K−1. Promising relationships are also found in the 90°–60°S and 30°–60°N regions, though these relationships are not robust across model generations and we have not identified the associated physical mechanisms. Clouds are the largest source of uncertainty in projections of future climate change. One promising approach for constraining how clouds will change in a warmer world is “emergent constraints” in which some quantity that we can observe today, like monthly cloud variability, is related to some aspect of the climate system’s response to warming, like the strength of the cloud feedback. A number of emergent constraints based on cloud variability have been proposed; however, while these worked well in the previous generation of climate models (CMIP5), they perform poorly in the newest generation of climate models (CMIP6). Here, we propose that emergent constraints on clouds can still be useful for constraining regional cloud changes, even if they cannot be used to constrain changes in global cloud cover. Using simple metrics of regional cloud variability, we demonstrate the existence of strong relationships between metrics of monthly/interannual cloud variability and the long‐term tropical cloud feedback. These relationships are robust across the model generations, and allow us to substantially narrow the uncertainty in the tropical cloud feedback. Promising relationships are also seen in several other regions, but these are less robust across the model generations.

	abstract = {The quantification of tropospheric O3 production in the downwind of the Mexico City plume is a major objective of the MIRAGE-Mex field campaign. We used a regional chemistry-transport model (WRF-Chem) to predict the distribution of O3 and its precursors in Mexico City and the surrounding region during March 2006, and compared the model with in-situ aircraft measurements of O3, CO, VOCs, NOx, and NOy concentrations. The comparison shows that the model is capable of capturing the timing and location of the measured city plumes, and the calculated variability along the flights is generally consistent with the measured results, showing a rapid increase in O3 and its precursors when city plumes are detected. However, there are some notable differences between the calculated and measured values, suggesting that, during transport from the surface of the city to the outflow plume, ozone mixing ratios are underestimated by about 0–25\% during different flights. The calculated O3-NOx, O3-CO, and O3-NOz correlations generally agree with the measured values, and the analyses of these correlations suggest that photochemical O3 production continues in the plume downwind of the city (aged plume), adding to the O3 already produced in the city and exported with the plume. The model is also used to quantify the contributions to OH reactivity from various compounds in the aged plume. This analysis suggests that oxygenated organics (OVOCs) have the highest OH reactivity and play important roles for the O3 production in the aging plume. Furthermore, O3 production per NOx molecule consumed (O3 production efficiency) is more efficient in the aged plume than in the young plume near the city. The major contributor to the high O3 production efficiency in the aged plume is the reaction RO2+NO. By contrast, the reaction of HO2+NO is rather uniformly distributed in the plume.},

TCAP was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program and was designed to obtain observations within two atmospheric columns; one fixed over Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and the other several hundred kilometers over the ocean. The performance is quantified using most of the available aircraft and surface measurements during July, and 2 days are examined in more detail to identify the processes responsible for the observed aerosol layers. The higher-resolution WRF-Chem model produced more aerosol mass in the free troposphere than the coarser-resolution CAM5 model so that the fraction of aerosol optical thickness above the residual layer from WRF-Chem was more consistent with lidar measurements. We found that the free troposphere layers are likely due to mean vertical motions associated with synoptic-scale convergence that lifts aerosols from the boundary layer. The vertical displacement and the time period associated with upward transport in the troposphere depend on the strength of the synoptic system and whether relatively high boundary layer aerosol concentrations are present where convergence occurs. While a parameterization of subgrid scale convective clouds applied in WRF-Chem modulated the concentrations of aerosols aloft, it did not significantly change the overall altitude and depth of the layers.},

	abstract = {Emergent constraints are quantities which are observable from current measurements and have skill predicting future climate. This study explores 19 previously-proposed emergent constraints related to equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, the global-average equilibrium surface temperature response to CO2 doubling). Several constraints are shown to be closely related, emphasizing the importance for careful understanding of proposed constraints. A new method is presented for decomposing correlation between an emergent constraint and ECS into terms related to physical processes and geographical regions. Using this decomposition, one can determine whether the processes and regions explaining correlation with ECS correspond to the physical explanation offered for the constraint. Shortwave cloud feedback is generally found to be the dominant contributor to correlations with ECS because it is the largest source of inter-model spread in ECS. In all cases, correlation results from interaction between a variety of terms, reflecting the complex nature of ECS and the fact that feedback terms and forcing are themselves correlated with each other. For 4 of the 19 constraints, the originally-proposed explanation for correlation is borne out by our analysis. These 4 constraints all predict relatively high climate sensitivity. The credibility of 6 other constraints is called into question due to correlation with ECS coming mainly from unexpected sources and/or lack of robustness to changes in ensembles. Another 6 constraints lack a testable explanation and hence cannot be confirmed. The fact that this study casts doubt upon more constraints than it confirms highlights the need for caution when identifying emergent constraints from small ensembles.},

As a result, the region was a focus in atmospheric science at that time. However, as sailing ships were replaced by steamboats, scientific interest shifted to the heavy precipitating storms within the doldrums: the deep convective systems of the intertropical convergence zone. Now, in storm-system-resolving simulations over a period of two months that cover a large part of the tropical Atlantic, the doldrums are one of the most prominent features. The doldrums are substantially less pronounced in coarser-resolution simulations that use a parameterization for convection, despite their large-scale extent. We conclude that explicitly representing the storm scale dynamics and their coupling to the surface wind on the storm-system scales helps to maintain the systems of winds that define the doldrums. We suggest that the lack of these wind systems could explain the persistent tropical precipitation biases in climate models. Storm-resolving simulations of the tropical Atlantic region bring out the doldrums, a zone of calm and variable winds in the deep tropics that was described in the nineteenth century and then forgotten.},

	abstract = {Black Carbon (BC) aerosols substantially affect the global climate. However, accurate simulation of BC atmospheric transport remains elusive, due to shortcomings in modeling and a shortage of constraining measurements. Recently, several studies have compared simulations with observed vertical concentration profiles, and diagnosed a global-mean BC atmospheric residence time of {\textless}5 days. These studies have, however, been focused on limited geographical regions, and used temporally and spatially coarse model information. Here we expand on previous results by comparing a wide range of recent aircraft measurements from multiple regions, including the Arctic and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, to simulated distributions obtained at varying spatial and temporal resolution. By perturbing BC removal processes and using current best-estimate emissions, we confirm a constraint on the global-mean BC lifetime of {\textless}5.5 days, shorter than in many current global models, over a broader geographical range than has so far been possible. Sampling resolution influences the results, although generally without introducing major bias. However, we uncover large regional differences in the diagnosed lifetime, in particular in the Arctic. We also find that only a weak constraint can be placed in the African outflow region over the South Atlantic, indicating inaccurate emission sources or model representation of transport and microphysical processes. While our results confirm that BC lifetime is shorter than predicted by most recent climate models, they also cast doubt on the usability of the concept of a “global-mean BC lifetime” for climate impact studies, or as an indicator of model skill. A geographically wide set of aircraft measurements show that the lifetime of black carbon aerosols in the atmosphere is less than five days. Chemical transport simulations are key for assessing the climate impact of black carbon aerosols, but their evaluation has been limited by sparse observations. Marianne T. Lund, from the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, and colleagues compare a wide range of aircraft black carbon concentrations from 2008–2017 with two chemistry transport models to confirm a short black carbon lifetime of less than 5 days. While this global mean lifetime applies over a wide geographical range, they also find important regional discrepancies, in particular in the Arctic. These findings caution against using a global-mean lifetime to diagnose the impact of black carbon on warming.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather and climate‐related events occur in a particular place, by definition, infrequently. It is therefore challenging to detect systematic changes in their occurrence given the relative shortness of observational records. However, there is a clear interest from outside the climate science community in the extent to which recent damaging extreme events can be linked to human‐induced climate change or natural climate variability. Event attribution studies seek to determine to what extent anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability or magnitude of particular events. They have shown clear evidence for human influence having increased the probability of many extremely warm seasonal temperatures and reduced the probability of extremely cold seasonal temperatures in many parts of the world. The evidence for human influence on the probability of extreme precipitation events, droughts, and storms is more mixed. Although the science of event attribution has developed rapidly in recent years, geographical coverage of events remains patchy and based on the interests and capabilities of individual research groups. The development of operational event attribution would allow a more timely and methodical production of attribution assessments than currently obtained on an ad hoc basis. For event attribution assessments to be most useful, remaining scientific uncertainties need to be robustly assessed and the results clearly communicated. This requires the continuing development of methodologies to assess the reliability of event attribution results and further work to understand the potential utility of event attribution for stakeholder groups and decision makers.

Current parameterizations are designed by humans based on physical understanding, observations, and process modeling. As a result, they are numerically efficient and interpretable, but potentially oversimplified. However, the advent of global high‐resolution simulations and observations enables a more robust approach based on machine learning. In this letter, a neural network‐based parameterization is trained using a near‐global aqua‐planet simulation with a 4‐km resolution (NG‐Aqua). The neural network predicts the apparent sources of heat and moisture averaged onto (160 km)2 grid boxes. A numerically stable scheme is obtained by minimizing the prediction error over multiple time steps rather than single one. In prognostic single‐column model tests, this scheme matches both the fluctuations and equilibrium of NG‐Aqua simulation better than the Community Atmosphere Model does. Computer‐based atmospheric models predict future conditions based on physical laws. Unfortunately, current computers are not powerful enough to simulate these physical laws exactly and must represent the atmosphere as a 3‐D digital image, with a pixel size, also known as resolution, of 100–200 km. Scientists typically approximate any processes that occur below this size, such as rain clouds, using idealized physical models. Unfortunately, the ability of these models to represent the atmosphere's true complexity is limited by a scientist's imagination. The recent availability of large data sets, computational resources, and developments in computer science allows a different approach based on machine learning. In this article, we train one popular kind of machine learning model, known as neural network, to approximate the small‐scale processes in climate model based on a high‐resolution atmospheric simulation. To produce an accurate prediction, we had to reduce the prediction error of many days, rather than just a few hours. The resulting neural network matches the high‐resolution simulation better than a state of the art traditional climate model does, a heartening result which suggests that machine learning can be blended with traditional approaches to produce better predictions of future weather and climate.

Such comparisons have been performed for five different aerosol subtypes classified by CALIOP algorithm, namely clean marine, dust, polluted dust, polluted continental, and biomass burning, over the ocean from June 2006 to December 2010. MODIS AOD at 550 nm (0.111 ± 0.079) for the collocated data pairs is about 63\% higher than CALIOP AOD at 532 nm (0.068 ± 0.073). For clean marine, MODIS AOD (0.110 ± 0.064) is almost twice the CALIOP AOD (0.056 ± 0.038), and the difference between the AOD values has a strong latitude dependence likely related to the surface wind speed over the ocean. The difference in AOD for dust (13\%) is observed to be the lowest among the five aerosol types under consideration, but it shows a slight regional variation. The discrepancy of AOD for dust also shows strong dependency on the layer mean of the particulate depolarization ratio. CALIOP AOD is higher than MODIS AOD for both polluted dust and polluted continental by 15\% and 29\%, respectively, for most of the ocean. One of the possible reasons for the difference is the misclassification of clean marine (or marine + dust) as polluted dust and polluted continental in the CALIOP algorithm. For biomass burning, uncertainty in the layer base altitude is thought to be one of the main reasons for the lower value of CALIOP AOD.},

We evaluate effective radiative forcing and adjustments in 17 contemporary climate models that are participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and have contributed to the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP). Present-day (2014) global-mean anthropogenic forcing relative to pre-industrial (1850) levels from climate models stands at 2.00 (±0.23) W m-2, comprised of 1.81 (±0.09) W m-2 from CO2, 1.08 (± 0.21) W m-2 from other well-mixed greenhouse gases, -1.01 (± 0.23) W m-2 from aerosols and -0.09 (±0.13) W m-2 from land use change. Quoted uncertainties are 1 standard deviation across model best estimates, and 90 \% confidence in the reported forcings, due to internal variability, is typically within 0.1 W m-2. The majority of the remaining 0.21 W m-2 is likely to be from ozone. In most cases, the largest contributors to the spread in effective radiative forcing (ERF) is from the instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) and from cloud responses, particularly aerosol–cloud interactions to aerosol forcing. As determined in previous studies, cancellation of tropospheric and surface adjustments means that the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing is approximately equal to ERF for greenhouse gas forcing but not for aerosols, and consequentially, not for the anthropogenic total. The spread of aerosol forcing ranges from -0.63 to -1.37 W m-2, exhibiting a less negative mean and narrower range compared to 10 CMIP5 models. The spread in 4×CO2 forcing has also narrowed in CMIP6 compared to 13 CMIP5 models. Aerosol forcing is uncorrelated with climate sensitivity. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the increasing spread in climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models, particularly related to high-sensitivity models, is a consequence of a stronger negative present-day aerosol forcing and little evidence that modelling groups are systematically tuning climate sensitivity or aerosol forcing to recreate observed historical warming.},

An unphysical checkerboard pattern has recently been identified in the multiscale modeling framework configuration of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM-MMF) that is hypothesized to be associated with the inability of large-scale dynamics to transport fluctuations within the embedded cloud-resolving model (CRM) on the global grid. To address this issue, a method is presented to facilitate the large-scale transport of CRM variance in E3SM-MMF. Simulation results show that the method is effective at reducing the occurrence of unphysical checkerboard patterns on a range of timescales from days to years. This result is confirmed both subjectively through visual inspection and quantitatively with a previously developed pattern categorization technique. The CRM variance transport does not significantly alter the model climate, although it does tend to reduce temporal variance on fields associated with convection on the global grid.},

	abstract = {Lateral mixing parameters in buoyancy-driven deep convection schemes are among the most sensitive and important unknowns in atmosphere models. Unfortunately, there is not a true optimum value for plume mixing rate, but rather a dilemma or tradeoff: Excessive dilution of updrafts leads to unstable stratification bias in the mean state, while inadequate dilution allows deep convection to occur too easily, causing poor space and time distributions and variability. In this too-small parameter space, compromises are made based on competing metrics of model performance. We attempt to escape this “entrainment dilemma” by making bulk plume parameters (chiefly entrainment rate) depend on a new prognostic variable (“organization,” org) meant to reflect the rectified effects of subgrid-scale structure in meteorological fields. We test an org scheme in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) with a new unified shallow-deep convection scheme (UW-ens, a 2-plume version of the University of Washington scheme). Since buoyant ascent involves natural selection, subgrid structure makes convection systematically deeper and stronger than the pure unorganized case: plumes of average (or randomly sampled) air rising in the average environment. To reflect this, org is nonnegative, but we leave it dimensionless. A time scale characterizes its behavior (here ∼3 h for a 2o model). Currently its source is rain evaporation, but other sources can be added easily. We also let org be horizontally transported by advection, as a mass-weighted mean over the convecting layer. Linear coefficients link org to a plume ensemble, which it assists via: 1) plume base warmth above the mean temperature 2) plume radius enhancement (reduced mixing), and 3) increased probability of overlap in a multi-plume scheme, where interactions benefit later generations (this part has only been implemented in an offline toy column model). Since rain evaporation is a source for org, it functions as a time-lagged but positive feedback on deep convection development. This evades the entrainment dilemma, since fully developed org–enhanced convection is not overly dilute, avoiding stability bias, while the pioneering updrafts of new convection are suppressed by entrainment, encouraging more large-scale variability.},

	abstract = {A previous study on the use of nudging in E3SM Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1) had an unresolved issue; i.e., a simulation nudged to EAMv1's own meteorology showed non-negligible deviations from the free-running baseline simulation over some of the subtropical marine stratocumulus and trade cumulus regions. Here, we demonstrate that the deviations can be substantially reduced by (1) changing where the nudging tendency is calculated in the time integration loop of a nudged EAM simulation so as to improve consistency with the free-running baseline and (2) increasing the frequency of the constraining data so as to better capture strong sub-diurnal variations. The fact that modification (2) improves the climate representativeness of the nudged simulations has motivated us to investigate whether the use of newer reanalysis products with higher data frequency can help improve nudged hindcast simulations by better capturing the observed weather events. To answer this question, we present simulations conducted at EAMv1's standard horizontal resolution (approximately 1∘) with nudging towards 6-hourly ERA-Interim reanalysis or 6-hourly, 3-hourly, or hourly ERA5 reanalysis. These simulations are evaluated against the climatology of free-running EAMv1 simulations as well as reanalyses, satellite retrievals, and in situ measurements from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement user facility. For the 1∘ EAMv1 simulations, we recommend using the relocated nudging tendency calculation and the ERA5 reanalysis at 3-hourly or higher frequency. Simulations used for estimating the anthropogenic aerosol effects often use nudging to help discern signal from noise. The sensitivity of such estimates to the configuration of nudging is investigated in EAMv1, again using the standard 1∘ horizontal resolution. We find that, when estimating the global mean effects, the frequency of constraining data has relatively small impacts, while the choice of nudged variables can change the results substantially. The nudging of air temperature (in addition to horizontal winds) has two non-negligible effects. First, when the constraining data come from reanalysis, the nudging-induced mean bias correction can cause significant changes in the simulated clouds and hence substantially different estimates of the aerosol effects. The impact of the mean bias correction on ice cloud formation has been noted in previous studies and is also seen in EAMv1. For applications like ours, where the preferred configurations of nudging are those capable of providing results consistent with the multi-year free-running simulations, the consequence of the mean bias correction is undesirable. The second important impact of temperature nudging is a significant suppression of adjustments to aerosol forcing, which also causes changes in the estimated aerosol effects. This effect can be seen in simulations nudged to either reanalysis or EAM's own meteorology. These results suggest that nudging horizontal winds but not temperature is a better choice for estimating the anthropogenic aerosol effects.},

This review covers the observational evidence on climate phenomena and the governing equations of planetary-scale flow and presents the key concept of a hierarchy of models for use in the climate sciences. Recent advances in the application of dynamical systems theory, on the one hand, and nonequilibrium statistical physics, on the other hand, are brought together for the first time and shown to complement each other in helping understand and predict the system’s behavior.

	abstract = {Tropospheric aerosol radiative forcing has persisted for many years as one of the major causes of uncertainty in global climate model simulations. To sample the range of plausible aerosol and atmospheric states and perform robust statistical analyses of the radiative forcing, it is important to account for the combined effects of many sources of model uncertainty, which is rarely done due to the high computational cost. This paper describes the designs of two ensembles of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model‐U.K. Chemistry and Aerosol global climate model and provides the first analyses of the uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing and their causes. The first ensemble was designed to comprehensively sample uncertainty in the aerosol state, while the other samples additional uncertainties in the physical model related to clouds, humidity, and radiation, thereby allowing an analysis of uncertainty in the aerosol effective radiative forcing. Each ensemble consists of around 200 simulations of the preindustrial and present‐day atmospheres. The uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing in our ensembles is comparable to the range of estimates from multimodel intercomparison projects. The mean aerosol effective radiative forcing is −1.45 W/m2 (credible interval of −2.07 to −0.81 W/m2), which encompasses but is more negative than the −1.17 W/m2 in the 2013 Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and −0.90 W/m2 in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. The ensembles can be used to reduce aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty by challenging them with multiple measurements as well as to isolate potential causes of multimodel differences. Atmospheric aerosol particles such as dust, pollutants, and smoke interfere with light from the Sun and modify the properties of clouds and thereby affect Earth's climate. However, the effect that aerosols have on climate is one of the major causes of uncertainty in global climate model simulations. We performed a large number of climate model simulations (called an ensemble), with many parts of the model slightly varied, in order to understand the complex behavior of the model and to explore the causes of uncertainty in model outputs. This paper describes the designs of two climate model ensembles and provides the first analyses of the causes of model uncertainty. The first ensemble was designed to comprehensively understand the behavior of aerosols in the atmosphere, while the other includes more general uncertainties in atmospheric processes that can affect aerosols. Each ensemble consists of around 200 simulations. The ranges of the aerosol climate effect in our ensembles are comparable to the ranges of previous estimates from studies that analyzed multiple climate models. These ensembles can be used to reduce uncertainty in how aerosols affect climate by comparing with satellite and ground‐based measurements. Two ensembles of atmospheric simulations were performed perturbing aerosol and physical parameters under different model setups Thousands of Gaussian process emulators sampling parameter spaces enabled statistical analyses of model's parametric uncertainty. Fully explored parametric uncertainty of aerosol radiative forcing in a model was found to be comparable to that in multimodel studies},

Setting these parameters traditionally relies heavily on insights from those involved in parameterisation of the underlying climate processes. Given the many degrees of freedom and computational expense involved in evaluating such a selection, this can be imperfect leaving open questions about whether any subsequent simulated biases result from mis-set parameters or wider structural model errors (such as missing or partially parameterised processes). Here we present a complementary approach to identifying plausible climate model parameters, with a method of bias correcting subcomponents of a climate model using a Gaussian process emulator that allows credible values of model input parameters to be found even in the presence of a significant model bias.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}A previous study (McNeall et al., 2016) found that a climate model had to be run using land surface input parameter values from very different, almost non-overlapping parts of parameter space to satisfactorily simulate the Amazon and other forests respectively. As the forest fraction of modelled non-Amazon forests was broadly correct at the default parameter settings and the Amazon too low, that study suggested that the problem most likely lay in the model's treatment of non-plant processes in the Amazon region. This might be due to (1) modelling errors such as missing deep-rooting in the Amazon in the land surface component of the climate model, (2) a warm-dry bias in the Amazon climate of the model, or a combination of both.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In this study we bias correct the climate of the Amazon in a climate model using an {\textless}q{\textgreater}augmented{\textless}/q{\textgreater} Gaussian process emulator, where temperature and precipitation, variables usually regarded as model outputs, are treated as model inputs alongside regular land surface input parameters. A sensitivity analysis finds that the forest fraction is nearly as sensitive to climate variables as changes in its land surface parameter values. Bias correcting the climate in the Amazon region using the emulator corrects the forest fraction to tolerable levels in the Amazon at many candidates for land surface input parameter values, including the default ones, and increases the valid input space shared with the other forests. We need not invoke a structural model error in the land surface model, beyond having too dry and hot a climate in the Amazon region.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The augmented emulator allows bias correction of an ensemble of climate model runs and reduces the risk of choosing poor parameter values because of an error in a subcomponent of the model.

Prior studies support improved air quality under NTCF mitigation, but with conflicting climate impacts that range from a significant reduction in the rate of global warming to only a modest impact. Here, we use state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model simulations conducted as part of the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) to quantify the 21st-century impact of NTCF reductions, using a realistic future emission scenario with a consistent air quality policy. Non-methane NTCF (NMNTCF; aerosols and ozone precursors) mitigation improves air quality, but leads to significant increases in global mean precipitation of 1.3\% by mid-century and 1.4\% by end-of-the-century, and corresponding surface warming of 0.23 and 0.21 K. NTCF (all-NTCF; including methane) mitigation further improves air quality, with larger reductions of up to 45\% for ozone pollution, while offsetting half of the wetting by mid-century (0.7\% increase) and all the wetting by end-of-the-century (non-significant 0.1\% increase) and leading to surface cooling of 0.15 K by mid-century and 0.50 K by end-of-the-century. This suggests that methane mitigation offsets warming induced from reductions in NMNTCFs, while also leading to net improvements in air quality.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Earth system models (ESMs) are invaluable tools to study the climate system's response to specific greenhouse gas emission pathways. Large single-model initial-condition and multi-model ensembles are used to investigate the range of possible responses and serve as input to climate impact and integrated assessment models. Thereby, climate signal uncertainty is propagated along the uncertainty chain and its effect on interactions between humans and the Earth system can be quantified. However, generating both single-model initial-condition and multi-model ensembles is computationally expensive. In this study, we assess the feasibility of geographically explicit climate model emulation, i.e., of statistically producing large ensembles of land temperature field time series that closely resemble ESM runs at a negligible computational cost. For this purpose, we develop a modular emulation framework which consists of (i) a global mean temperature module, (ii) a local temperature response module, and (iii) a local residual temperature variability module. Based on this framework, MESMER, a Modular Earth System Model Emulator with spatially Resolved output, is built. We first show that to successfully mimic single-model initial-condition ensembles of yearly temperature from 1870 to 2100 on grid-point to regional scales with MESMER, it is sufficient to train on a single ESM run, but separate emulators need to be calibrated for individual ESMs given fundamental inter-model differences. We then emulate 40 climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to create a “superensemble”, i.e., a large ensemble which closely resembles a multi-model initial-condition ensemble. The thereby emerging ESM-specific emulator parameters provide essential insights on inter-model differences across a broad range of scales and characterize core properties of each ESM. Our results highlight that, for temperature at the spatiotemporal scales considered here, it is likely more advantageous to invest computational resources into generating multi-model ensembles rather than large single-model initial-condition ensembles. Such multi-model ensembles can be extended to superensembles with emulators like the one presented here.},

In many cases, the physical mechanisms responsible for observed cloud dynamics are unknown, making it difficult to simulate their structure and behaviour realistically. Feingold et al. use satellite imagery and numerical models to show how downdrafts induced by precipitating clouds produce an open cellular cloud pattern — characterized by low reflectivity — that oscillates between different, metastable states. The resulting cloud structure forms an oscillating and self-organizing cloud field as new cloud patterns emerge to replace the old ones. Cloud simulation is one of the most challenging tasks in regional to global-scale modelling. In many cases, the physical mechanisms responsible for observed cloud dynamics are unknown, making it difficult to realistically simulate their structure and behaviour. These authors show that open cellular clouds — characterized by low albedo — can be created by precipitation-driven downdrafts and that the resulting cloud structure forms an oscillating, self-organizing cloud field. Cloud fields adopt many different patterns that can have a profound effect on the amount of sunlight reflected back to space, with important implications for the Earth’s climate. These cloud patterns can be observed in satellite images of the Earth and often exhibit distinct cell-like structures associated with organized convection at scales of tens of kilometres1,2,3. Recent evidence has shown that atmospheric aerosol particles—through their influence on precipitation formation—help to determine whether cloud fields take on closed (more reflective) or open (less reflective) cellular patterns4,5. The physical mechanisms controlling the formation and evolution of these cells, however, are still poorly understood6, limiting our ability to simulate realistically the effects of clouds on global reflectance. Here we use satellite imagery and numerical models to show how precipitating clouds produce an open cellular cloud pattern that oscillates between different, weakly stable states. The oscillations are a result of precipitation causing downward motion and outflow from clouds that were previously positively buoyant. The evaporating precipitation drives air down to the Earth’s surface, where it diverges and collides with the outflows of neighbouring precipitating cells. These colliding outflows form surface convergence zones and new cloud formation. In turn, the newly formed clouds produce precipitation and new colliding outflow patterns that are displaced from the previous ones. As successive cycles of this kind unfold, convergence zones alternate with divergence zones and new cloud patterns emerge to replace old ones. The result is an oscillating, self-organized system with a characteristic cell size and precipitation frequency.},

A CCN closure study for the entire campaign period was performed where measured CCN concentrations at 0.24\% and 0.46\% supersaturation were compared with the predicted CCN concentrations calculated using κ‐Köhler theory, three different assumptions of aerosol mixing state, and various assumptions about hygroscopicity, density, and the insoluble fraction of organic particles. We found that the Closure Ratio (CR), calculated as the ratio of predicted to measured CCN concentrations, was equal to one under two different aerosol mixing state assumptions: (a) all particles are composed of 100\% organic particles, and (b) particles are externally mixed and composed of pure sulfates, nitrates, and organic particles assuming hygroscopicity values for organic particles () between 0.04 and 0.17. The use of internal mixing state assumption often led to overprediction of CCN concentrations but the agreement within ±20\% with the measured CCN concentrations was observed under certain closure permutations. A similar agreement, that is, within ±20\%, was also observed using permuted parameters concerning density (1 and 1.5 g cm−3) and an insoluble fraction (0\% and 20\%) of organic particles. These findings may provide constraints on to predict CCN concentrations at a remote continental Southern Great Plains site. A large number of foreign particles suspended in the atmosphere, or atmospheric aerosols, provide centers upon which water‐vapor condensation could occur. The affinity of various atmospheric aerosols for water is a key factor controlling their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and hence the study of CCN is of prime importance to understanding the formation of clouds—the key components of the Earth's atmosphere. Such hygroscopic behavior of aerosols from a remote continental Southern Great Plains (SGP) geographical region, where airmass arrives from local and long distances is poorly understood. The airborne measurements of these individual mixed aerosols at SGP were performed using a research aircraft. We analyzed the size and number counts and CCN properties of these individual particles using different assumptions of the chemical composition that each particle is made up of. We find that if all the particles are composed of 100\% organics, or if the particle population consists of three aerosol types with each type composed of pure organics, sulfates, and nitrates, then one can theoretically calculate CCN numbers within 20\% uncertainty under certain thermodynamic conditions. Our conclusions may be useful to model hygroscopicity values of ambient aerosol from the SGP site. Aerosol cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) characteristics such as hygroscopicity and closure ratio (CR) for each constant altitude leg of the entire campaign were assessed The CCN CR was calculated under various permutations concerning the hygroscopicity, solubility, and density of organic particles A modest closure using a single component, internal, and external aerosol mixing states at certain permutation parameters can be achieved Aerosol cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) characteristics such as hygroscopicity and closure ratio (CR) for each constant altitude leg of the entire campaign were assessed The CCN CR was calculated under various permutations concerning the hygroscopicity, solubility, and density of organic particles A modest closure using a single component, internal, and external aerosol mixing states at certain permutation parameters can be achieved},

It consists of one year of 1km resolution MODIS hyperspectral imagery merged with pixel-width 'tracks' of CloudSat cloud labels. Bringing these complementary datasets together is a crucial first step, enabling the Machine-Learning community to develop innovative new techniques which could greatly benefit the Climate community.

The model began as a fork of the well‐known Community Atmosphere Model, but it has evolved in new ways, and coding, performance, resolution, physical processes (primarily cloud and aerosols formulations), testing and development procedures now differ significantly. Vertical resolution was increased (from 30 to 72 layers), and the model top extended to 60 km ({\textasciitilde}0.1 hPa). A simple ozone photochemistry predicts stratospheric ozone, and the model now supports increased and more realistic variability in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. An optional improved treatment of light‐absorbing particle deposition to snowpack and ice is available, and stronger connections with Earth system biogeochemistry can be used for some science problems. Satellite and ground‐based cloud and aerosol simulators were implemented to facilitate evaluation of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol‐cloud interactions. Higher horizontal and vertical resolution, increased complexity, and more predicted and transported variables have increased the model computational cost and changed the simulations considerably. These changes required development of alternate strategies for tuning and evaluation as it was not feasible to “brute force” tune the high‐resolution configurations, so short‐term hindcasts, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, and regionally refined simulations provided guidance on tuning and parameterization sensitivity to higher resolution.

	abstract = {Skillful forecasts of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) at long lead times (4–5 months in advance) pose great challenges due to strong internal variability of the monsoon system and nonstationarity of climatic drivers. Here, we use an advanced causal discovery algorithm coupled with a response-guided detection step to detect low-frequency, remote processes that provide sources of predictability for the ISMR. The algorithm identifies causal precursors without any a priori assumptions, apart from the selected variables and lead times. Using these causal precursors, a statistical hindcast model is formulated to predict seasonal ISMR that yields valuable skill with correlation coefficient (CC) {\textasciitilde}0.8 at a 4-month lead time. The causal precursors identified are generally in agreement with statistical predictors conventionally used by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); however, our methodology provides precursors that are automatically updated, providing emerging new patterns. Analyzing ENSO-positive and ENSO-negative years separately helps to identify the different mechanisms at play during different years and may help to understand the strong nonstationarity of ISMR precursors over time. We construct operational forecasts for both shorter (2-month) and longer (4-month) lead times and show significant skill over the 1981–2004 period (CC {\textasciitilde}0.4) for both lead times, comparable with that of IMD predictions (CC {\textasciitilde}0.3). Our method is objective and automatized and can be trained for specific regions and time scales that are of interest to stakeholders, providing the potential to improve seasonal ISMR forecasts.},

It is currently the only large ensemble available that includes scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and a 1\% CO2 scenario. These advantages make MPI‐GE a powerful tool. We present an overview of MPI‐GE, its components, and detail the experiments completed. We demonstrate how to separate the forced response from internal variability in a large ensemble. This separation allows the quantification of both the forced signal under climate change and the internal variability to unprecedented precision. We then demonstrate multiple ways to evaluate MPI‐GE and put observations in the context of a large ensemble, including a novel approach for comparing model internal variability with estimated observed variability. Finally, we present four novel analyses, which can only be completed using a large ensemble. First, we address whether temperature and precipitation have a pathway dependence using the forcing scenarios. Second, the forced signal of the highly noisy atmospheric circulation is computed, and different drivers are identified to be important for the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions. Third, we use the ensemble dimension to investigate the time dependency of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability changes under global warming. Last, sea level pressure is used as an example to demonstrate how MPI‐GE can be utilized to estimate the ensemble size needed for a given scientific problem and provide insights for future ensemble projects. The 100‐member MPI‐GE is currently the largest publicly available ensemble of a comprehensive climate model MPI‐GE currently has the most forcing scenarios of all large ensemble projects: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5, and 1\% CO2 The power of MPI‐GE is to estimate the forced response and internal variability, including changing variability, to unprecedented precision},

We show that this question not only rests on solid theoretical grounds but also offers insightful applications in practice. By comparing four observational products of sea surface temperature with a large multimodel climate forecast ensemble, we find compelling evidence that models systematically score better against the most recent, advanced, but also most independent product.

	abstract = {Chemical and aerosol processes in the transition from closed- to open-cell circulation in the remote, cloudy marine boundary layer are explored. It has previously been shown that precipitation can initiate a transition from the closed- to the open-cellular state, but that the boundary layer cannot maintain this open-cell state without a resupply of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Potential sources of CCN include wind-driven production of sea salt from the ocean, nucleation from the gas phase, and entrainment from the free troposphere. In order to investigate CCN sources in the marine boundary layer and their role in supplying new particles, we have coupled in detail chemical, aerosol, and cloud processes in the WRF/Chem model, and added state-of-the-art representations of sea salt emissions and aerosol nucleation. We conduct numerical simulations of the marine boundary layer in the transition from a closed- to an open-cell state. Results are compared with observations in the Southeast Pacific boundary layer during the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx). The transition from the closed- to the open-cell state generates conditions that are conducive to nucleation by forming a cloud-scavenged, ultra-clean layer below the inversion base. Open cell updrafts loft dimethyl sulfide from the ocean surface into the ultra-clean layer, where it is oxidized during daytime to SO2 and subsequently to H2SO4. Low H2SO4 condensation sink values in the ultra-clean layer allow H2SO4 to rise to concentrations at which aerosol nucleation produces new aerosol in significant numbers. The existence of the ultra-clean layer is confirmed by observations. We find that the observed DMS flux from the ocean in the VOCALS-REx region can support a nucleation source of aerosol in open cells that exceeds sea salt emissions in terms of the number of particles produced. The freshly nucleated, nanometer-sized aerosol particles need, however, time to grow to sizes large enough to act as CCN. In contrast, mechanical production of particles from the ocean surface by near-surface winds provides a steady source of larger particles that are effective CCN at a rate exceeding a threshold for maintenance of open-cell circulation. Entrainment of aerosol from the free troposphere contributes significantly to boundary layer aerosol for the considered VOCALS-REx case, but less than sea salt aerosol emissions.},

Here we apply causal discovery algorithms to sea level pressure data from a large set of climate model simulations and, as a proxy for observations, meteorological reanalyses. We demonstrate how the resulting causal networks (fingerprints) offer an objective pathway for process-oriented model evaluation. Models with fingerprints closer to observations better reproduce important precipitation patterns over highly populated areas such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, East Asia, Europe and North America. We further identify expected model interdependencies due to shared development backgrounds. Finally, our network metrics provide stronger relationships for constraining precipitation projections under climate change as compared to traditional evaluation metrics for storm tracks or precipitation itself. Such emergent relationships highlight the potential of causal networks to constrain longstanding uncertainties in climate change projections. Algorithms to assess causal relationships in data sets have seen increasing applications in climate science in recent years. Here, the authors show that these techniques can help to systematically evaluate the performance of climate models and, as a result, to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections.},

	abstract = {The international airport of Heathrow is a major source of nitrogen oxides, but its contribution to the levels of sub-micrometre particles is unknown and is the objective of this study. Two sampling campaigns were carried out during warm and cold seasons at a site close to the airfield (1.2 km). Size spectra were largely dominated by ultrafine particles: nucleation particles ( \&amp;lt; 30 nm) were found to be ∼ 10 times higher than those commonly measured in urban background environments of London. Five clusters and six factors were identified by applying \textit{k} means cluster analysis and positive matrix factorisation (PMF), respectively, to particle number size distributions; their interpretation was based on their modal structures, wind directionality, diurnal patterns, road and airport traffic volumes, and on the relationship with weather and other air pollutants. Airport emissions, fresh and aged road traffic, urban accumulation mode, and two secondary sources were then identified and apportioned. The fingerprint of Heathrow has a characteristic modal structure peaking at \&amp;lt; 20 nm and accounts for 30–35 \% of total particles in both the seasons. Other main contributors are fresh (24–36 \%) and aged (16–21 \%) road traffic emissions and urban accumulation from London (around 10 \%). Secondary sources accounted for less than 6 \% in number concentrations but for more than 50 \% in volume concentration. The analysis of a strong regional nucleation event showed that both the cluster categorisation and PMF contributions were affected during the first 6 h of the event. In 2016, the UK government provisionally approved the construction of a third runway; therefore the direct and indirect impact of Heathrow on local air quality is expected to increase unless mitigation strategies are applied successfully.},

This allows us not only to rule out many potential explanations for observed diurnal changes, but to infer fundamental information concerning the nature and location of the principal global climate forcings of this century. We conclude that the observed changes of the diurnal cycle result neither from natural climate variability nor a globally-distributed forcing, but rather they require the combination of a (negative) radiative forcing located primarily over continental regions together with the known globally-distributed forcing due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Tropospheric aerosols can account for part of the continentally-located forcing, but alone they do not damp the diurnal cycle as observed. Only an increase of continental cloud cover, possibly a consequence of anthropogenic aerosols, can damp the diurnal cycle by an amount comparable to observations. A corollary of these results is quantitative confirmation of the widely held suspicion that anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming has been substantially counterbalanced by a forced cooling. Under the assumption that the cloud change is sulfate driven, a further implication is that the net rate of global warming is likely to increase substantially in coming years. We note that, on the long run, the daily maximum temperature will increase by an amount not much less than the increase of the mean temperature.},

	abstract = {We analyze the theoretical basis of three different methods to validate and intercompare satellite measurements of atmospheric composition, and apply them to tropospheric ozone retrievals from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The first method (in situ method) uses in situ vertical profiles for absolute instrument validation; it is limited by the sparseness of in situ data. The second method (CTM method) uses a chemical transport model (CTM) as an intercomparison platform; it provides a globally complete intercomparison with relatively small noise from model error. The third method (averaging kernel smoothing method) involves smoothing the retrieved profile from one instrument with the averaging kernel matrix of the other; it also provides a global intercomparison but dampens the actual difference between instruments and adds noise from the a priori. We apply the three methods to a full year (2006) of TES and OMI data. Comparison with in situ data from ozonesondes shows mean positive biases of 5.3 parts per billion volume (ppbv) (10\%) for TES and 2.8 ppbv (5\%) for OMI at 500 hPa. We show that the CTM method (using the GEOS-Chem CTM) closely approximates results from the in situ method while providing global coverage. It reveals that differences between TES and OMI are generally less than 10 ppbv (18\%), except at northern mid-latitudes in summer and over tropical continents. The CTM method further allows for CTM evaluation using both satellite observations. We thus find that GEOS-Chem underestimates tropospheric ozone in the tropics due to possible underestimates of biomass burning, soil, and lightning emissions. It overestimates ozone in the northern subtropics and southern mid-latitudes, likely because of excessive stratospheric influx of ozone.},

However, these hybrid ML-physics simulations require domain-specific data and workflows that have been inaccessible to many ML experts.

	abstract = {Synoptic-scale pollution plumes in the free troposphere can preserve their identity as well-defined structures for a week or more while traveling around the globe. Eulerian chemical transport models (CTMs) have difficulty reproducing these layered structures due to numerical plume dissipation. We show that this dissipation is much faster than would be expected from the order of the advection scheme because of interaction between numerical diffusion and the nonuniformity of the atmospheric flow. The nonuniform flow stretches out the plume, enhancing the effect of numerical diffusion. For sufficiently strong stretching, the numerical decay of the plume is independent of the model grid resolution and is set instead by the flow Lyapunov exponent λ. In this regime, conventional numerical methods are not convergent: upon increasing grid resolution, the plume still decays with the same decay rate. The critical plume size below which the numerical scheme does not converge is set by the geometric mean of the grid spacing and the characteristic length scale l = v/λ over which the flow varies, where v is the wind speed. Above this critical plume size the numerically induced decay rate of the plume scales like the square root of the grid spacing. Application to an intercontinental pollution plume in a global CTM with realistic atmospheric flow shows that proper simulation of such a plume would require an impractical increase in grid resolution. Novel methods such as adaptive grids or embedded Lagrangian plumes are needed.},

These software libraries come preloaded with a variety of network architectures, provide autodifferentiation, and support GPUs for fast and efficient computation. As a result, a deep learning practitioner will favor training a neural network model in Python, where these tools are readily available. However, many large-scale scientific computation projects are written in Fortran, making it difficult to integrate with modern deep learning methods. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a software library, the Fortran-Keras Bridge (FKB). This two-way bridge connects environments where deep learning resources are plentiful with those where they are scarce. The paper describes several unique features offered by FKB, such as customizable layers, loss functions, and network ensembles. The paper concludes with a case study that applies FKB to address open questions about the robustness of an experimental approach to global climate simulation, in which subgrid physics are outsourced to deep neural network emulators. In this context, FKB enables a hyperparameter search of one hundred plus candidate models of subgrid cloud and radiation physics, initially implemented in Keras, to be transferred and used in Fortran. Such a process allows the model’s emergent behavior to be assessed, i.e., when fit imperfections are coupled to explicit planetary-scale fluid dynamics. The results reveal a previously unrecognized strong relationship between offline validation error and online performance, in which the choice of the optimizer proves unexpectedly critical. This in turn reveals many new neural network architectures that produce considerable improvements in climate model stability including some with reduced error, for an especially challenging training dataset.},

In two versions of the ECHAM-HAM model, different time integration methods are used to solve the sulfuric acid (H$_{\textrm{2}}$SO$_{\textrm{4}}$) gas evolution equation, which lead to substantially different results in the H$_{\textrm{2}}$SO$_{\textrm{4}}$ gas concentration and the aerosol nucleation rate. Using convergence tests and sensitivity simulations performed with various time stepping schemes, it is confirmed that numerical errors in the second model version are significantly smaller than those in version one. The use of sequential operator splitting in combination with a long time step is identified as the main reason for the large systematic biases in the old model. The remaining errors of nucleation rate in version two, related to the competition between condensation and nucleation, have a clear impact on the simulated concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the lower troposphere. These errors can be significantly reduced by employing solvers that handle production, condensation and nucleation at the same time. Lessons learned in this work underline the need for more caution when treating multi-timescale problems involving compensating and competing processes, a common occurrence in current climate models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Subkilometer processes are critical to the physics of aerosol‐cloud interaction (ACI) but have been dependent on parameterizations in global model simulations. We thus report the strength of ACI in the Ultra‐Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (UPCAM), a multiscale climate model that uses coarse exterior resolution to embed explicit cloud‐resolving models with enough resolution (250 m horizontal, 20 m vertical) to quasi‐resolve subkilometer eddies. To investigate the impact on ACIs, UPCAM's simulations are compared to a coarser multiscale model with 4 km horizontal resolution. UPCAM produces cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) and cloud liquid water path (LWP) values that are higher than the coarser model but equally plausible compared to observations. Our analysis focuses on the Northern Hemisphere (20–50°N) oceans, where historical aerosol increases have been largest. We find similarities in the overall radiative forcing from ACIs in the two models, but this belies fundamental underlying differences. The radiative forcing from increases in LWP is weaker in UPCAM, whereas the forcing from increases in Nd is larger. Surprisingly, the weaker LWP increase is not due to a weaker increase in LWP in raining clouds, but a combination of weaker increase in LWP in nonraining clouds and a smaller fraction of raining clouds in UPCAM. The implication is that as global modeling moves toward finer than storm‐resolving grids, nuanced model validation of ACI statistics conditioned on the existence of precipitation and good observational constraints on the baseline probability of precipitation will become key for tighter constraints and better conceptual understanding. How aerosol particles impact the climate through their interactions with clouds is a significant source of uncertainty in quantifying the drivers of climate change over the past hundred years. Global climate models have so far been heavily reliant on approximations of the physical processes that occur at subkilometer scales, even though processes at those scales are important for representing the physics behind aerosol‐cloud interactions. To address this gap, we develop and run a multiscale global model that embeds a finer‐scale model (250 m in the horizontal and 20 m in the vertical) within the columns of a coarser‐resolution global model. A pair of simulations with preindustrial and present‐day aerosol emissions is used to quantify the impact of human aerosol emissions. They show that the climate impact of resolving subkilometer resolutions is relatively small. However, this masks some key differences. The increase in cloud water with increasing aerosols is substantially weaker when subkilometer motions are resolved. Most of this weakening is due to a weaker response in nonraining clouds and there being fewer clouds that rain in the high‐resolution model. The simulation results point to observations of specific processes that can help further constrain the impact of aerosols on clouds and climate. Aerosol‐cloud interactions in a global model that resolves subkilometer processes are compared to those in a coarser 4 km model Over the Northern Hemisphere ocean, resolving subkilometer scales leads to a weaker increase in liquid water path with aerosols Weaker LWP increase is due to fewer precipitating clouds and weaker LWP increase in nonraining clouds},

While the seasonal variations of regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been extensively studied, understanding the temporal variations in aerosol vertical distribution and particle types is also important for an accurate estimate of aerosol climatic effects. In this paper, we combine the observations from four satellite-borne sensors and several ground-based networks to investigate the seasonal variations of aerosol column loading, vertical distribution, and particle types over three populous regions: the Eastern United States (EUS), Western Europe (WEU), and Eastern and Central China (ECC). In all three regions, column AOD, as well as AOD at heights above 800{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m, peaks in summer/spring, probably due to accelerated formation of secondary aerosols and hygroscopic growth. In contrast, AOD below 800{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m peaks in winter over WEU and ECC regions because more aerosols are confined to lower heights due to the weaker vertical mixing. In the EUS region, AOD below 800{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m shows two maximums, one in summer and the other in winter. The temporal trends in low-level AOD are consistent with those in surface fine particle (PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$) concentrations. AOD due to fine particles ( \&amp;lt; 0.7{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}µm diameter) is much larger in spring/summer than in winter over all three regions. However, the coarse mode AOD ( \&amp;gt; 1.4{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}µm diameter), generally shows small variability, except that a peak occurs in spring in the ECC region due to the prevalence of airborne dust during this season. When aerosols are classified according to sources, the dominant type is associated with anthropogenic air pollution, which has a similar seasonal pattern as total AOD. Dust and sea-spray aerosols in the WEU region peak in summer and winter, respectively, but do not show an obvious seasonal pattern in the EUS region. Smoke aerosols, as well as absorbing aerosols, present an obvious unimodal distribution with a maximum occurring in summer over the EUS and WEU regions, whereas they follow a bimodal distribution with peaks in August and March (due to crop residue burning) over the ECC region.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The change in planetary albedo due to aerosol−cloud interactions during the industrial era is the leading source of uncertainty in inferring Earth’s climate sensitivity to increased greenhouse gases from the historical record. The variable that controls aerosol−cloud interactions in warm clouds is droplet number concentration. Global climate models demonstrate that the present-day hemispheric contrast in cloud droplet number concentration between the pristine Southern Hemisphere and the polluted Northern Hemisphere oceans can be used as a proxy for anthropogenically driven change in cloud droplet number concentration. Remotely sensed estimates constrain this change in droplet number concentration to be between 8 cm−3 and 24 cm−3. By extension, the radiative forcing since 1850 from aerosol−cloud interactions is constrained to be −1.2 W⋅m−2 to −0.6 W⋅m−2. The robustness of this constraint depends upon the assumption that pristine Southern Ocean droplet number concentration is a suitable proxy for preindustrial concentrations. Droplet number concentrations calculated from satellite data over the Southern Ocean are high in austral summer. Near Antarctica, they reach values typical of Northern Hemisphere polluted outflows. These concentrations are found to agree with several in situ datasets. In contrast, climate models show systematic underpredictions of cloud droplet number concentration across the Southern Ocean. Near Antarctica, where precipitation sinks of aerosol are small, the underestimation by climate models is particularly large. This motivates the need for detailed process studies of aerosol production and aerosol−cloud interactions in pristine environments. The hemispheric difference in satellite estimated cloud droplet number concentration implies preindustrial aerosol concentrations were higher than estimated by most models.},

	abstract = {Underestimation of the proportion of supercooled liquid in mixed‐phase clouds in climate models has called into question its impact on Arctic climate change. We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic. Warming of Earth's Arctic at a faster pace relative to the rest of the globe is referred to as “Arctic amplification.” Mixed‐phase clouds consisting of both liquid droplets and ice crystals are ubiquitous in Earth's Arctic. The ratio of liquid to ice in mixed‐phase clouds is typically underestimated in climate models and has been shown to lead to underestimates in global warming by underestimating the strength of the “cloud phase feedback.” Replacement of cloud ice with liquid as Earth warms results in more reflected sunlight to space. Therefore, a low cloud liquid bias results in a global overestimate of the negative cloud phase feedback. In this study, we find that correcting this low bias can simultaneously reduce Arctic amplification by reducing longwave radiation to the surface that is trapped as heat in the Arctic. However, the effect is highly sensitive to the size of the cloud particles. Ice particles typically precipitate faster than liquid droplets so replacement of larger ice particles with liquid results in longer‐lived clouds that radiate more longwave radiation to the surface, which ultimately leads to enhanced Arctic amplification. The results of this study emphasize the importance of realistic representations of mixed‐phase cloud microphysics in climate models. Partitioning of cloud phase in a climate model impacts Arctic amplification via longwave radiation as a consequence of the cloud phase feedback The strength and magnitude of the impact of cloud phase on Arctic amplification depend on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds},

The impacts derived from climate models are poorly constrained by observations because retrieving robust large-scale signals of aerosol–cloud interactions is frequently hampered by the considerable noise associated with meteorological co-variability. The 2014 Holuhraun effusive eruption in Iceland resulted in a massive aerosol plume in an otherwise near-pristine environment and thus provided an ideal natural experiment to quantify cloud responses to aerosol perturbations. Here we disentangle significant signals from the noise of meteorological co-variability using a satellite-based machine-learning approach. Our analysis shows that aerosols from the eruption increased cloud cover by approximately 10\%, and this appears to be the leading cause of climate forcing, rather than cloud brightening as previously thought. We find that volcanic aerosols do brighten clouds by reducing droplet size, but this has a notably smaller radiative impact than changes in cloud fraction. These results add substantial observational constraints on the cooling impact of aerosols. Such constraints are critical for improving climate models, which still inadequately represent the complex macro-physical and microphysical impacts of aerosol–cloud interactions. Satellite-based machine-learning analysis of a diffusive volcanic eruption suggests that aerosol climate forcing is dominated by changes in cloud cover, rather than changes in cloud brightness.},

This paper evaluates a proposed method to constrain modeled cloud liquid water path (LWP) adjustments in response to changes in aerosol concentration Na using observations of precipitation susceptibility. Recent climate modeling has suggested a linear relationship between relative LWP responses to relative changes in Na, i.e., dln LWP / dln Na, and the precipitation frequency susceptibility Spop, which is defined as the relative change in the probability of precipitation for a relative change in Na. Using large-eddy simulations (LES) of marine stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus clouds, we show that these two cloud regimes exhibit qualitatively different relationships between λ and Spop; in stratocumulus clouds, λ increases with Spop, while in trade wind cumulus, λ decreases with Spop. The LES-derived relationship for marine stratocumulus is qualitatively similar but quantitatively different than that derived from climate model simulations of oceanic clouds aggregated over much larger spatial scales. We explore possible reasons for variability in these relationships, including the selected precipitation threshold and the various definitions of precipitation susceptibility that are currently in use. Because aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions are inherently small-scale processes, we recommend that when deriving the relationship between λ and Spop, careful attention be given to the cloud regime, the scale, and the extent of aggregation of the model output or the observed data.},

Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming. The change in global mean temperature in response to a change in external forcing is highly uncertain; here differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere are shown to explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity, constraining the predicted equilibrium climate sensitivity to an increase of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius. This paper offers an explanation for the long-standing uncertainty in predictions of global warming derived from climate models. Uncertainties in predicted climate sensitivity — the magnitude of global warming due to an external influence — range from 1.5° C to 5° C for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. It has been assumed that uncertainties in cloud simulations are at the root of the model disparities, and here Steven Sherwood et al. examine the output of 43 climate models and demonstrate that about half of the total uncertainty in climate sensitivity can be traced to the varying treatment of mixing between the lower and middle troposphere — and mostly in the tropics. When constrained by observations, the authors' modelling suggests that climate sensitivity is likely to exceed 3° C rather than the currently estimated lower limit of 1.5° C, thereby constraining model projections towards more severe future warming.},

We present estimates of patterns for temperature and precipitation change from the latest transient simulations available from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), focusing on multi-model mean patterns, and characterizing the sources of variability of these patterns across models and scenarios. The patterns are compared to those obtained from the previous set of experiments, under CMIP3. We estimate the significance of the emerging differences between CMIP3 and CMIP5 results through a bootstrap exercise, while also taking into account the fundamental differences in scenario and model ensemble composition. All in all, the robustness of the geographical features in patterns of temperature and precipitation, when computed as multi-model means, is confirmed by this comparison. The intensity of the change (in both the warmer and cooler areas with respect to global temperature change, and the drier and wetter regions) is overall heightened per degree of global warming in the ensemble mean of the new simulations. The presence of stabilized scenarios in the new set of simulations allows investigation of the performance of the technique once the system has gotten close to equilibrium. Overall, the well established validity of the technique in approximating the forced signal of change under increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is confirmed.},

	abstract = {An important metric for temperature projections is the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), which is defined as the global mean surface air temperature change caused by a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The range for ECS assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report is between 1.5 and 4.5 K and has not decreased over the last decades. Among other methods, emergent constraints are potentially promising approaches to reduce the range of ECS by combining observations and output from Earth System Models (ESMs). In this study, we systematically analyze 11 published emergent constraints on ECS that have mostly been derived from models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) project. These emergent constraints are – except for one that is based on temperature variability – all directly or indirectly based on cloud processes, which are the major source of spread in ECS among current models. The focus of the study is on testing if these emergent constraints hold for ESMs participating in the new Phase 6 (CMIP6). Since none of the emergent constraints considered here have been derived using the CMIP6 ensemble, CMIP6 can be used for cross-checking of the emergent constraints on a new model ensemble. The application of the emergent constraints to CMIP6 data shows a decrease in skill and statistical significance of the emergent relationship for nearly all constraints, with this decrease being large in many cases. Consequently, the size of the constrained ECS ranges (66 \% confidence intervals) widens by 51 \% on average in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5. This is likely because of changes in the representation of cloud processes from CMIP5 to CMIP6, but may in some cases also be due to spurious statistical relationships or a too small number of models in the ensemble that the emergent constraint was originally derived from. The emergently- constrained best estimates of ECS also increased from CMIP5 to CMIP6 by 12 \% on average. This can be at least partly explained by the increased number of high-ECS (above 4.5 K) models in CMIP6 without a corresponding change in the constraint predictors, suggesting the emergence of new feedback processes rather than changes in strength of those previously dominant. Our results support previous studies concluding that emergent constraints should be based on an independently verifiable physical mechanism, and that process-based emergent constraints on ECS should rather be thought of as constraints for the process or feedback they are actually targeting.},

These cloud clusters are then used to classify CFMIP Observation Simulator Package output from the HadGEM3 (GA7) atmosphere‐only climate model. Discrepancies in the GA7 representation of particular clusters can be established by examining the two sets of cluster's occurrence rate and radiative effect. The overall differences in the occurrence rates show major discrepancies in several of the clusters, resulting in a shift from five dominant clusters in MODIS (above 10 \% occurrence rate) to two dominant clusters in the model. A comparison of the geographic distributions of occurrence rate shows that the differences are strongly regional and unique to each cluster. While comparisons of the global mean longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) show strong agreement, examination of the CRE of individual cloud types reveals larger errors which highlight the role of compensating errors in masking model deficiencies. CRE data for each of the clusters is further partitioned into regions. This establishes that the bias associated with a cluster is highly variable globally, with no clusters showing consistent biases across all regions. Therefore, regional level phenomena likely play an important role in the creation of these errors. Clusters are generated by applying a self organizing map to MODIS joint histograms of cloud. Radiative differences between the model and observations are attributed to specific clusters. Regional cloud radiative effect errors are obscured by compensating errors between clusters.},

The field intensive phase of VOCALS-REx took place during October and November 2008 and constitutes a critical part of a broader CLIVAR program (VOCALS) designed to develop and promote scientific activities leading to improved understanding, model simulations, and predictions of the southeastern Pacific (SEP) coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system, on diurnal to interannual timescales. The other major components of VOCALS are a modeling program with a model hierarchy ranging from the local to global scales, and a suite of extended observations from regular research cruises, instrumented moorings, and satellites. The two central themes of VOCALS-REx focus upon (a) links between aerosols, clouds and precipitation and their impacts on marine stratocumulus radiative properties, and (b) physical and chemical couplings between the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere, including the role that mesoscale ocean eddies play. A set of hypotheses designed to be tested with the combined field, monitoring and modeling work in VOCALS is presented here. A further goal of VOCALS-REx is to provide datasets for the evaluation and improvement of large-scale numerical models.

These properties are necessary to model how aerosols affect climate, and our review is targeted specifically for that application. We recommend the term light-absorbing carbon to avoid conflict with operationally based definitions. Absorptive properties depend on molecular form, particularly the size of sp 2-bonded clusters. Freshly-generated particles should be represented as aggregates, and their absorption is like that of particles small relative to the wavelength. Previous compendia have yielded a wide range of values for both refractive indices and absorption cross section. The absorptive properties of light-absorbing carbon are not as variable as is commonly believed. Our tabulation suggests a mass-normalized absorption cross section of 7.5 ± 1.2 m2/g at 550 nm for uncoated particles. We recommend a narrow range of refractive indices for strongly-absorbing carbon particles, of which the highest is 1.95–0.79i. Our refractive indices are consistent with most measurements reported in the literature, and values used in present-day climate modeling are in error. Realistic refractive indices underpredict measured absorption by about 30\% when used with common theories for spherical particles or aggregates. Field programs since about 1970 have measured quantities relevant to light absorption, but have only recently made enough measurements to isolate the light-absorbing carbonaceous component and determine its absorptive properties.},

The optimizations include limiting the chemical compounds and physical processes available in different size sections of aerosol particles; division of the size distribution into size sections using size sections of variable width depending on the sensitivity of microphysical processing to the particles sizes; the total amount of size sections to describe the size distribution is kept to the minimum; furthermore, only the relevant microphysical processes affecting each size section are calculated. The ability of the module to describe different microphysical processes was evaluated against explicit microphysical models and several microphysical models used in air quality models.

However, our knowledge of forced changes in the overall spectrum of climate variability and higher-order statistics is relatively limited. Here we present a new 100-member large ensemble of climate change projections conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 2 over 1850–2100 to examine the sensitivity of internal climate fluctuations to greenhouse warming. Our unprecedented simulations reveal that changes in variability, considered broadly in terms of probability distribution, amplitude, frequency, phasing, and patterns, are ubiquitous and span a wide range of physical and ecosystem variables across many spatial and temporal scales. Greenhouse warming in the model alters variance spectra of Earth system variables that are characterized by non-Gaussian probability distributions, such as rainfall, primary production, or fire occurrence.

We argue that the meridional width of tropical precipitation is controlled by the seasonal meridional range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The contraction of tropical precipitation under greenhouse forcing results from a reduced seasonal range of ITCZ migration. An energetic theory—similar to the energetic theory for ITCZ shifts based on the hemispheric contrast of energy input to the atmosphere—is developed. The meridional width of tropical precipitation is proportional to the seasonal range of the interhemispheric contrast in atmospheric heating divided by the efficiency of atmospheric cross‐equatorial heat transport. Climate models are biased toward overly expansive tropical precipitation resulting from an exaggerated seasonal atmospheric heating. The robust contraction of tropical precipitation under global warming results from increased efficiency of interhemispheric energy transport consistent with enhanced gross moist stability of the tropical atmosphere. The seasonal range of ITCZ migrations (SRITCZ) controls the meridional extent of tropical precipitation SRITCZ is larger than observed in most climate models resulting in a double‐ITCZ bias Under global warming, SRITCZ decreases due to more efficient cross‐equatorial heat transport and tropical precipitation contracts},

	abstract = {The Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument onboard the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) spacecraft has provided over 8 yr of nearly continuous vertical profiling of Earth's atmosphere. In this paper we investigate the V3.01 and V3.02 CALIOP 532 nm aerosol layer optical depth (AOD) product (i.e the AOD of individual layers) and the column AOD product (i.e., the sum AOD of the complete column) using an extensive database of coincident measurements. The CALIOP AOD measurements and AOD uncertainty estimates are compared with collocated AOD measurements collected with the NASA High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) in the North American and Caribbean regions. In addition, the CALIOP aerosol lidar ratios are investigated using the HSRL measurements. In general, compared with the HSRL values, the CALIOP layer AOD are biased high by less than 50\% for AOD We estimated the CALIOP column AOD error can be expressed as ±0.05 ± 0.07 · (HSRL column AOD) at night and ±0.08 ± 0.1 · (HSRL column AOD) during the daytime. Multiple sources of error contribute to both positive and negative errors in the CALIOP column AOD, including multiple layers in the column of different aerosol types, lidar ratio errors, cloud misclassification, and undetected aerosol layers. The undetected layers were further investigated and we found that the layer detection algorithm works well at night, although undetected aerosols in the free troposphere introduce a mean underestimate of 0.02 in the column AOD in the data set examined. The decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during the daytime led to poorer performance of the layer detection. This caused the daytime CALIOP column AOD to be less accurate than during the nighttime, because CALIOP frequently does not detect optically thin aerosol layers with AOD −1 at night and 0.067 km−1 during the daytime in a layer median sense. This extensive validation of level 2 CALIOP AOD products extends previous validation studies to nighttime lighting conditions and provides independent measurements of the lidar ratio; thus, allowing the assessment of the effect on the CALIOP AOD of using inappropriate lidar ratio values in the extinction retrieval.},

	abstract = {Cloud microphysical process rates control the amount of condensed water in clouds and impact the susceptibility of precipitation to cloud-drop number and aerosols. The relative importance of different microphysical processes in a climate model is analyzed, and the autoconversion and accretion processes are found to be critical to the condensate budget in most regions. A simple steady-state model of warm rain formation is used to illustrate that the diagnostic rain formulations typical of climate models may result in excessive contributions from autoconversion, compared to observations and large eddy simulation models with explicit bin-resolved microphysics and rain formation processes. The behavior does not appear to be caused by the bulk process rate formulations themselves, because the steady-state model with the same bulk accretion and autoconversion has reduced contributions from autoconversion. Sensitivity tests are conducted to analyze how perturbations to the precipitation microphysics for stratiform clouds impact process rates, precipitation susceptibility and aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI). With similar liquid water path, corrections for the diagnostic rain assumptions in the GCM based on the steady-state model to boost accretion indicate that the radiative effects of ACI may decrease by 20\% in the GCM. Links between process rates, susceptibility and ACI are not always clear in the GCM. Better representation of the precipitation process, for example by prognosticating precipitation mass and number, may help better constrain these effects in global models with bulk microphysics schemes.},

	abstract = {The observed warming in the atmosphere and ocean can be used to estimate the climate sensitivity linked to present-day feedbacks, which is referred to as the effective climate sensitivity (Shist). However, such an estimate is affected by uncertainty in the radiative forcing, particularly aerosols, over the historical period. Here, we make use of detection and attribution techniques to derive the surface air temperature and ocean warming that can be attributed directly to greenhouse gas increases. These serve as inputs to a simple energy budget to infer the likelihood of Shist in response to observed greenhouse gases increases over two time periods (18622012 and 19552012). The benefit of using greenhouse gas attributable quantities is that they are not subject to uncertainties in the aerosol forcing (other than uncertainty in the attribution to greenhouse gas versus aerosol forcing not captured by the multi-model aerosol response pattern). The resulting effective climate sensitivity estimate, Shist, ranges from 1.3 C to 3.1 C (595 range) over the full instrumental period (18622012) for our best estimate, and gets slightly wider when considering further uncertainties. This estimate increases to 1.7 C4.6 C if using the shorter period (19552012). We also evaluate the climate model simulated surface air temperature and ocean heat content increase in response to greenhouse gas forcing over the same periods, and compare them with the observationally-constrained values. We find that that the ocean warming simulated in greenhouse gas only simulations in models considered here is consistent with that attributed to greenhouse gas increases from observations, while one model simulates more greenhouse gas-induced surface air warming than observed. However, other models with sensitivity outside our range show greenhouse gas warming that is consistent with that attributed in observations, emphasising that feedbacks during the historical period may differ from the feedbacks at CO2 doubling and from those at true equilibrium.},

	abstract = {A modal aerosol module (MAM) has been developed for the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). MAM is capable of simulating the aerosol size distribution and both internal and external mixing between aerosol components, treating numerous complicated aerosol processes and aerosol physical, chemical and optical properties in a physically-based manner. Two MAM versions were developed: a more complete version with seven lognormal modes (MAM7), and a version with three lognormal modes (MAM3) for the purpose of long-term (decades to centuries) simulations. In this paper a description and evaluation of the aerosol module and its two representations are provided. Sensitivity of the aerosol lifecycle to simplifications in the representation of aerosol is discussed. Simulated sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass concentrations are remarkably similar between MAM3 and MAM7. Differences in primary organic matter (POM) and black carbon (BC) concentrations between MAM3 and MAM7 are also small (mostly within 10\%). The mineral dust global burden differs by 10\% and sea salt burden by 30–40\% between MAM3 and MAM7, mainly due to the different size ranges for dust and sea salt modes and different standard deviations of the log-normal size distribution for sea salt modes between MAM3 and MAM7. The model is able to qualitatively capture the observed geographical and temporal variations of aerosol mass and number concentrations, size distributions, and aerosol optical properties. However, there are noticeable biases; e.g., simulated BC concentrations are significantly lower than measurements in the Arctic. There is a low bias in modeled aerosol optical depth on the global scale, especially in the developing countries. These biases in aerosol simulations clearly indicate the need for improvements of aerosol processes (e.g., emission fluxes of anthropogenic aerosols and precursor gases in developing countries, boundary layer nucleation) and properties (e.g., primary aerosol emission size, POM hygroscopicity). In addition, the critical role of cloud properties (e.g., liquid water content, cloud fraction) responsible for the wet scavenging of aerosol is highlighted.},

The simulated liquid, ice and total water content and the cloud droplet and ice crystal number concentrations as a function of temperature in stratiform mixed-phase clouds between 0 and −35° C agree much better with aircraft observations in the ECHAM5 simulations. ECHAM5 performs better because more realistic aerosol concentrations are available for cloud droplet nucleation and because the Bergeron-Findeisen process is parameterized as being more efficient. The total anthropogenic aerosol effect includes the direct, semi-direct and indirect effects and is defined as the difference in the top-of-the-atmosphere net radiation between present-day and pre-industrial times. It amounts to −1.9 W m−2 in ECHAM5, when a relative humidity dependent cloud cover scheme and aerosol emissions representative for the years 1750 and 2000 from the AeroCom emission inventory are used. The contribution of the cloud albedo effect amounts to −0.7 W m−2. The total anthropogenic aerosol effect is larger when either a statistical cloud cover scheme or a different aerosol emission inventory are employed because the cloud lifetime effect increases.},

	abstract = {The intertropical convergence zone, where global rainfall is greatest, is a narrow belt of clouds usually centred about six degrees north of the Equator; this Review links its migrations on various timescales to the atmospheric energy balance. The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a vast area of high precipitation encircling much of the tropics, is not stable. It moves north and south on seasonal to millennial time scales. This Review presents a unified conceptual framework that explains ITCZ migrations in terms of the atmospheric energy balance, based on historical and palaeoclimate records. The authors propose that ITCZ location is governed by energy flux into and transport across the tropics. For example, as at present, greater atmospheric energy transport from north to south will place the ITCZ in the Northern Hemisphere. Cold periods, which may reverse the energy transport, will lead to southerly ITCZ movement. The ITCZ position is sensitive to slight shifts in the atmospheric energy balance however, because the factors controlling it are small differences between large terms. Rainfall on Earth is most intense in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a narrow belt of clouds centred on average around six degrees north of the Equator. The mean position of the ITCZ north of the Equator arises primarily because the Atlantic Ocean transports energy northward across the Equator, rendering the Northern Hemisphere warmer than the Southern Hemisphere. On seasonal and longer timescales, the ITCZ migrates, typically towards a warming hemisphere but with exceptions, such as during El Niño events. An emerging framework links the ITCZ to the atmospheric energy balance and may account for ITCZ variations on timescales from years to geological epochs.},

This increases cloud droplet numbers, which in turn affects other cloud properties like liquid-water content and ultimately cloud albedo. These adjustments are poorly constrained, making aerosol effects the most uncertain part of anthropogenic climate forcing. Here we show that cloud droplet number and water content react differently to changing emission amounts in shipping exhausts. We use information about ship positions and modeled emission amounts together with reanalysis winds and satellite retrievals of cloud properties. The analysis reveals that cloud droplet numbers respond linearly to emission amount over a large range (1–10 kg h-1) before the response saturates. Liquid water increases in raining clouds, and the anomalies are constant over the emission ranges observed. There is evidence that this independence of emissions is due to compensating effects under drier and more humid conditions, consistent with suppression of rain by enhanced aerosol. This has implications for our understanding of cloud processes and may improve the way clouds are represented in climate models, in particular by changing parameterizations of liquid-water responses to aerosol.},

Radiative transfer calculations are based on airborne aerosol and cloud measurements made on 7 September 2000, being representative for the aerosol optical properties and the relative location of aerosol and clouds during Southern African Fire-Atmosphere Research Initiative (SAFARI) 2000. We focus on how the radiative effects of biomass aerosol are changed in the presence of clouds to the west of the southern African coastline. The typical scenario observed showed a clear separation between an elevated biomass aerosol layer (1.8–3.7 km altitude) and low-level stratiform clouds (below 1 km, liquid water path 85 g m−2). The aerosol was characterized by particle concentrations of 1800 cm−3 and a single scattering albedo at 550 nm wavelength of around 0.90. Presuming no effect by the biomass aerosol on the clouds themselves, the presence of clouds converted the negative TOA forcing by the biomass aerosol in clear skies into a positive one (−13.0 W m−2 converted to +11.5 W m−2 for average optical properties of the biomass aerosol and a solar zenith angle of 60°). As biomass aerosol was found above cloud thousands of kilometers away from the southern African coastline, positive direct TOA forcings can be expected in extended sea areas over the Namibian cloud sheet. These results suggest errors in global climate model (GCM) modeling assessments of the direct radiative forcing due to biomass aerosols. Additionally, we estimate the possibility that a potential indirect effect dominates the overall forcing, resulting generally in strong negative TOA forcings.},

For instance, global emissions of aerosols and their precursors are projected to decrease by as much as 80 \% by the year 2100, according to the four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The removal of aerosols will cause unintended climate consequences, including an unmasking of global warming from long-lived greenhouse gases. We use the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Climate Model version 3 (GFDL CM3) to simulate future climate over the 21st century with and without the aerosol emission changes projected by each of the RCPs in order to isolate the radiative forcing and climate response resulting from the aerosol reductions. We find that the projected global radiative forcing and climate response due to aerosol decreases do not vary significantly across the four RCPs by 2100, although there is some mid-century variation, especially in cloud droplet effective radius, that closely follows the RCP emissions and energy consumption projections. Up to 1 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ of radiative forcing may be unmasked globally from 2005 to 2100 due to reductions in aerosol and precursor emissions, leading to average global temperature increases up to 1 K and global precipitation rate increases up to 0.09 mm day$^{\textrm{−1}}$. However, when using a version of CM3 with reduced present-day aerosol radiative forcing (−1.0 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$), the global temperature increase for RCP8.5 is about 0.5 K, with similar magnitude decreases in other climate response parameters as well. Regionally and locally, climate impacts can be much larger than the global mean, with a 2.1 K warming projected over China, Japan, and Korea due to the reduced aerosol emissions in RCP8.5, as well as nearly a 0.2 mm day$^{\textrm{−1}}$ precipitation increase, a 7 g m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ LWP decrease, and a 2 μm increase in cloud droplet effective radius. Future aerosol decreases could be responsible for 30–40 \% of total climate warming (or 10–20 \% with weaker aerosol forcing) by 2100 in East Asia, even under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP8.5). The expected unmasking of global warming caused by aerosol reductions will require more aggressive greenhouse gas mitigation policies than anticipated in order to meet desired climate targets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In this study a novel framework for inverse modelling of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra is developed using Köhler theory. The framework is established by using model-generated synthetic measurements as calibration data for a parametric sensitivity analysis. Assessment of the relative importance of aerosol physicochemical parameters, while accounting for bulk–surface partitioning of surface-active organic species, is carried out over a range of atmospherically relevant supersaturations. By introducing an objective function that provides a scalar metric for diagnosing the deviation of modelled CCN concentrations from synthetic observations, objective function response surfaces are presented as a function of model input parameters. Crucially, for the chosen calibration data, aerosol–CCN spectrum closure is confirmed as a well-posed inverse modelling exercise for a subset of the parameters explored herein. The response surface analysis indicates that the appointment of appropriate calibration data is particularly important. To perform an inverse aerosol–CCN closure analysis and constrain parametric uncertainties, it is shown that a high-resolution CCN spectrum definition of the calibration data is required where single-valued definitions may be expected to fail. Using Köhler theory to model CCN concentrations requires knowledge of many physicochemical parameters, some of which are difficult to measure in situ on the scale of interest and introduce a considerable amount of parametric uncertainty to model predictions. For all partitioning schemes and environments modelled, model output showed significant sensitivity to perturbations in aerosol log-normal parameters describing the accumulation mode, surface tension, organic : inorganic mass ratio, insoluble fraction, and solution ideality. Many response surfaces pertaining to these parameters contain well-defined minima and are therefore good candidates for calibration using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach to constraining parametric uncertainties.A complete treatment of bulk–surface partitioning is shown to predict CCN spectra similar to those calculated using classical Köhler theory with the surface tension of a pure water drop, as found in previous studies. In addition, model sensitivity to perturbations in the partitioning parameters was found to be negligible. As a result, this study supports previously held recommendations that complex surfactant effects might be neglected, and the continued use of classical Köhler theory in global climate models (GCMs) is recommended to avoid an additional computational burden. The framework developed is suitable for application to many additional composition-dependent processes that might impact CCN activation potential. However, the focus of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the applied sensitivity analysis to identify important parameters in those processes and will be extended to facilitate a global sensitivity analysis and inverse aerosol–CCN closure analysis.},

During the simulation period, a plume of biomass burning smoke from Africa moves into the area and mixes into the clouds. At Ascension Island, this smoke episode was the strongest of the 2016 fire season. The region of interest is simulated at 4 km resolution, with no parameterised convection scheme. The simulations are driven by, and compared to, the global model. For the first time, the UK Chemistry and Aerosol model (UKCA) is included in a regional model with prognostic aerosol number concentrations advecting in from the global model at the boundaries of the region. Fire emissions increase the total aerosol burden by a factor of 3.7 and cloud droplet number concentrations by a factor of 3, which is consistent with MODIS observations. In the regional model, the inversion height is reduced by up to 200 m when smoke is included. The smoke also affects precipitation, to an extent which depends on the model microphysics. The microphysical and dynamical changes lead to an increase in liquid water path of 60gm-2 relative to a simulation without smoke aerosol, when averaged over the polluted period. This increase is uncertain, and smaller in the global model. It is mostly due to radiatively driven dynamical changes rather than precipitation suppression by aerosol. Over the 5-day polluted period, the smoke has substantial direct radiative effects of +11.4Wm-2 in the regional model, a semi-direct effect of -30.5Wm-2 and an indirect effect of -10.1Wm-2. Our results show that the radiative effects are sensitive to the structure of the model (global versus regional) and the parameterization of rain autoconversion. Furthermore, we simulate a liquid water path that is biased high compared to satellite observations by 22 \% on average, and this leads to high estimates of the domain-averaged aerosol direct effect and the effect of the aerosol on cloud albedo. With these caveats, we simulate a large net cooling across the region, of -27.6Wm-2.},

Knowing how and why climate models are tuned and which targets are used is essential to avoiding possible misattributions of skillful predictions to data accommodation and vice versa. This paper describes the approach and practice of model tuning for the six major US climate modeling centers. While details differ among groups in terms of scientific missions, tuning targets, and tunable parameters, there is a core commonality of approaches. However, practices differ significantly on some key aspects, in particular, in the use of initialized forecast analyses as a tool, the explicit use of the historical transient record, and the use of the present-day radiative imbalance vs. the implied balance in the preindustrial era as a target.},

Perturbation strategies are proposed to characterize poorly known time-dependent input parameters, such as tropical cyclone track and wind as well as space-dependent bottom stresses, using a handful of stochastic variables. The input uncertainties are then propagated through an ensemble calculation and a model surrogate is constructed to represent the changes in model output caused by changes in the model input. The statistical analysis is then performed using the model surrogate once its reliability has been established. The procedure is illustrated by simulating the flooding caused by Hurricane Gustav 2008 using the ADvanced CIRCulation model. The hurricane’s track and intensity are perturbed along with the bottom friction coefficients. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the track of the tropical cyclone is the dominant contributor to the peak water level forecast, while uncertainties in wind speed and in the bottom friction coefficient show minor contributions. Exceedance probability maps with different levels are also estimated to identify the most vulnerable areas.},

Snow albedo feedback is particularly critical for climate change prediction in heavily-populated northern hemisphere land masses. Here we show its strength in current models exhibits a factor-of-three spread. These large intermodel variations in feedback strength in climate change are nearly perfectly correlated with comparably large intermodel variations in feedback strength in the context of the seasonal cycle. Moreover, the feedback strength in the real seasonal cycle can be measured and compared to simulated values. These mostly fall outside the range of the observed estimate, suggesting many models have an unrealistic snow albedo feedback in the seasonal cycle context. Because of the tight correlation between simulated feedback strength in the seasonal cycle and climate change, eliminating the model errors in the seasonal cycle will lead directly to a reduction in the spread of feedback strength in climate change. Though this comparison to observations may put the models in an unduly harsh light because of uncertainties in the observed estimate that are difficult to quantify, our results map out a clear strategy for targeted observation of the seasonal cycle to reduce divergence in simulations of climate sensitivity.},

Despite these advances, not all their impacts on cloud formation and evolution have been resolved. The resulting radiative forcing on the climate system due to aerosol-cloud interactions remains an unacceptably large uncertainty in future climate projections.

An important issue for these decision makers, and for organizations that fund climate research, is what is the potential for climate science to deliver improvements—especially reductions in uncertainty—in such predictions? Uncertainty in climate predictions arises from three distinct sources: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Using data from a suite of climate models, we separate and quantify these sources. For predictions of changes in surface air temperature on decadal timescales and regional spatial scales, we show that uncertainty for the next few decades is dominated by sources (model uncertainty and internal variability) that are potentially reducible through progress in climate science. Furthermore, we find that model uncertainty is of greater importance than internal variability. Our findings have implications for managing adaptation to a changing climate. Because the costs of adaptation are very large, and greater uncertainty about future climate is likely to be associated with more expensive adaptation, reducing uncertainty in climate predictions is potentially of enormous economic value. We highlight the need for much more work to compare (a) the cost of various degrees of adaptation, given current levels of uncertainty and (b) the cost of new investments in climate science to reduce current levels of uncertainty. Our study also highlights the importance of targeting climate science investments on the most promising opportunities to reduce prediction uncertainty.},

	abstract = {To prevent the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many countries around the world went into lockdown and imposed unprecedented containment measures. These restrictions progressively produced changes to social behavior and global mobility patterns, evidently disrupting social and economic activities. Here, using maritime traffic data collected via a global network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers, we analyze the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures had on the shipping industry, which accounts alone for more than 80\% of the world trade. We rely on multiple data-driven maritime mobility indexes to quantitatively assess ship mobility in a given unit of time. The mobility analysis here presented has a worldwide extent and is based on the computation of: Cumulative Navigated Miles (CNM) of all ships reporting their position and navigational status via AIS, number of active and idle ships, and fleet average speed. To highlight significant changes in shipping routes and operational patterns, we also compute and compare global and local vessel density maps. We compare 2020 mobility levels to those of previous years assuming that an unchanged growth rate would have been achieved, if not for COVID-19. Following the outbreak, we find an unprecedented drop in maritime mobility, across all categories of commercial shipping. With few exceptions, a generally reduced activity is observable from March to June 2020, when the most severe restrictions were in force. We quantify a variation of mobility between -5.62 and -13.77\% for container ships, between +2.28 and -3.32\% for dry bulk, between -0.22 and -9.27\% for wet bulk, and between -19.57 and -42.77\% for passenger traffic. The presented study is unprecedented for the uniqueness and completeness of the employed AIS dataset, which comprises a trillion AIS messages broadcast worldwide by 50,000 ships, a figure that closely parallels the documented size of the world merchant fleet.},

Even though our general understanding of error growth and predictability has been increasing, relatively little is known about the detailed structure of atmospheric predictability, such as how it varies between climate regions. The present study addresses this issue by exploring error growth and predictability in three latitude zones, using model output from a previous global storm-resolving predictability experiment by Judt published in 2018. It was determined that the tropics have longer predictability than the middle latitudes and polar regions (tropics, {\textgreater}20 days; middle latitudes and polar regions, a little over 2 weeks). Each latitude zone had distinct error growth characteristics, and error growth was broadly consistent with the underlying dynamics of each zone. Evidence suggests that equatorial waves play a role in the comparatively long predictability of the tropics; specifically, equatorial waves seem to be less prone to error growth than middle-latitude baroclinic disturbances. Even though the generality of the findings needs to be assessed in future studies, the overall conclusions agree with previous work in that current numerical weather prediction procedures have not reached the limits of atmospheric predictability, especially in the tropics. One way to exploit tropical predictability is to reduce model error, for example, by using global storm-resolving models instead of conventional models that parameterize convection.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosol effects on climate produce one of the largest uncertainties in estimates of radiative forcing of past and future climate change. Much of this uncertainty arises from the multi-scale nature of the interactions between aerosols, clouds and large-scale dynamics, which are difficult to represent in conventional general circulation models (GCMs). In this study, we develop a multi-scale aerosol-climate model that treats aerosols and clouds across different scales, and evaluate the model performance, with a focus on aerosol treatment. This new model is an extension of a multi-scale modeling framework (MMF) model that embeds a cloud-resolving model (CRM) within each grid column of a GCM. In this extension, the effects of clouds on aerosols are treated by using an explicit-cloud parameterized-pollutant (ECPP) approach that links aerosol and chemical processes on the large-scale grid with statistics of cloud properties and processes resolved by the CRM. A two-moment cloud microphysics scheme replaces the simple bulk microphysics scheme in the CRM, and a modal aerosol treatment is included in the GCM. With these extensions, this multi-scale aerosol-climate model allows the explicit simulation of aerosol and chemical processes in both stratiform and convective clouds on a global scale. Simulated aerosol budgets in this new model are in the ranges of other model studies. Simulated gas and aerosol concentrations are in reasonable agreement with observations (within a factor of 2 in most cases), although the model underestimates black carbon concentrations at the surface by a factor of 2–4. Simulated aerosol size distributions are in reasonable agreement with observations in the marine boundary layer and in the free troposphere, while the model underestimates the accumulation mode number concentrations near the surface, and overestimates the accumulation mode number concentrations in the middle and upper free troposphere by a factor of about 2. The overestimation of accumulation model number concentrations in the middle and upper free troposphere is consistent with large aerosol mass fraction above 5 km in the MMF model compared with other models. Simulated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations are within the observational variations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are in reasonable agreement with observations (within a factor of 2), and the spatial distribution of AOD is consistent with observations, while the model underestimates AOD over regions with strong fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions. Overall, this multi-scale aerosol-climate model simulates aerosol fields as well as conventional aerosol models.},

The cloud morphological categories are (i) organized closed MCC, (ii) organized open MCC and (iii) cellular but disorganized MCC. Global distributions of the frequency of occurrence of MCC types show clear regional signatures. Organized closed and open MCCs are most frequently found in subtropical regions and in midlatitude storm tracks of both hemispheres. Cellular but disorganized MCC are the predominant type of marine low clouds in regions with warmer sea surface temperature such as in the tropics and trade wind zones. All MCC types exhibit a pronounced seasonal cycle. The physical properties of MCCs such as cloud fraction, radar reflectivity, drizzle rates and cloud top heights as well as the radiative effects of MCCs are found highly variable and a function of the type of MCC. On a global scale, the cloud fraction is largest for closed MCC with mean cloud fractions of about 90\%, whereas cloud fractions of open and cellular but disorganized MCC are only about 51\% and 40\%, respectively. Probability density functions (PDFs) of cloud fractions are heavily skewed and exhibit modest regional variability. PDFs of column maximum radar reflectivities and inferred cloud base drizzle rates indicate fundamental differences in the cloud and precipitation characteristics of different MCC types. Similarly, the radiative effects of MCCs differ substantially from each other in terms of shortwave reflectance and transmissivity. These differences highlight the importance of low-cloud morphologies and their associated cloudiness on the shortwave cloud forcing.},

As a further step toward a better understanding of ERF uncertainty, the present study systematically investigates the sensitivity of the shortwave ERF at the top of the atmosphere to model‐internal variability and spatial distributions of the monthly mean radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosol. For this, ensembles are generated with the atmospheric model ECHAM6.3 that uses monthly prescribed optical properties and changes in cloud‐droplet number concentrations designed to mimic that associated with the anthropogenic aerosol using the new parameterization MACv2‐SP. The results foremost highlight the small change in our best estimate of the global averaged all‐sky ERF associated with a substantially different pattern of anthropogenic aerosol radiative effects from the mid‐1970s (–0.51 Wm–2) and present day (–0.50 Wm–2). Such a small change in ERF is difficult to detect when model‐internal year‐to‐year variability (0.32 Wm–2 standard deviation) is considered. A stable estimate of all‐sky ERF requires ensemble simulations, the size of which depends on the targeted precision, confidence level, and the magnitude of model‐internal variability. A larger effect of the pattern of the anthropogenic aerosol radiative effects on the globally averaged all‐sky ERF (15\%) occurs with a strong Twomey effect through lowering the background aerosol optical depth in regions downstream of major pollution sources. It suggests that models with strong aerosol‐cloud interactions could show a moderate difference in the global mean ERF associated with the mid‐1970s to present‐day change in the anthropogenic aerosol pattern. Ensembles of atmosphere‐only experiments with MACv2‐SP allow a sensitivity assessment of instantaneous and effective radiative forcing (ERF) Global mean all‐sky ERFs with aerosol patterns of mid‐1970s and today difficult to distinguish, when atmospheric variability considered A moderate pattern effect on ERF could occur in models with presumably strong aerosol‐cloud interaction},

	abstract = {Shallow cloud fields over the subtropical ocean exhibit many spatial patterns. The frequency of occurrence of these patterns can change under global warming. Hence, they may influence subtropical marine clouds’ climate feedback. While numerous metrics have been proposed to quantify cloud patterns, a systematic, widely accepted description is still missing. Therefore, this study suggests one. We compute 21 metrics for 5,000 satellite scenes of shallow clouds over the subtropical Atlantic Ocean and translate the resulting data set to its principal components (PCs). This yields a unimodal, continuous distribution without distinct classes, whose first four PCs explain 82\% of all 21 metrics’ variance. The PCs correspond to four interpretable dimensions: Characteristic length, void size, directional alignment, and horizontal cloud top height variance. These dimensions span a space in which an effective pattern description can be given, which may be used to better understand the patterns’ underlying physics and feedback on climate. Satellite images show that clouds which develop in the lowest 5 km of the atmosphere organize into many visually distinct patterns. Because different patterns reflect sunlight differently, a change in the relative occurrence of a pattern may influence Earth's response to warming. To study this effect, one typically first encapsulates various aspects of the complex patterns in a few, simple “metrics.” In this paper, we compute 21 commonly used metrics for 5,000 cloud fields observed by satellite over the Atlantic Ocean east of Barbados. We show that these 21 metrics contain a large amount of redundant information: To effectively describe and interpret the cloud patters, one only needs four derived metrics, which capture a cloud field's typical cloud size, the size of connected clear sky patches, the clouds’ degree of directional alignment and spatial variance in cloud top height. Combinations of these four metrics do not identify the existence of multiple, typical cloud patterns, as previously suggested. However, the four metrics form a new, effective and interpretable pattern description, which can be used to better understand how cloud patterns develop and how this impacts the wider climate system. Shallow cloud patterns in satellite observations are quantified by 21 metrics and follow a unimodal, continuous distribution Most existing metrics are redundant; four principal components capture 82\% of the variance of 21 metrics Characteristic length, void size, directional alignment, and cloud top height variance combine to effectively describe the patterns Shallow cloud patterns in satellite observations are quantified by 21 metrics and follow a unimodal, continuous distribution Most existing metrics are redundant; four principal components capture 82\% of the variance of 21 metrics Characteristic length, void size, directional alignment, and cloud top height variance combine to effectively describe the patterns},

	abstract = {Can we improve the modeling of urban land surface processes with machine learning (ML)? A prior comparison of urban land surface models (ULSMs) found that no single model is “best” at predicting all common surface fluxes. Here, we develop an urban neural network (UNN) trained on the mean predicted fluxes from 22 ULSMs at one site. The UNN emulates the mean output of ULSMs accurately. When compared to a reference ULSM (Town Energy Balance; TEB), the UNN has greater accuracy relative to flux observations, less computational cost, and requires fewer input parameters. When coupled to the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model using TensorFlow bindings, WRF‐UNN is stable and more accurate than the reference WRF‐TEB. Although the application is currently constrained by the training data (1 site), we show a novel approach to improve the modeling of surface fluxes by combining the strengths of several ULSMs into one using ML. Climate change and densely populated cities make the task of urban weather and climate prediction more and more critical to our society. In this study, we use machine learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of models predicting urban weather. We find great potential to use these types of machine learning models both as standalone tools and integrated into complex weather models.

We use the relatively simple general circulation models (GCMs) PUMA and PLASIM as a simplified reality on which we train deep neural networks, which we then use for predicting the model weather at lead times of a few days. We specifically assess how the complexity of the climate model affects the neural network's forecast skill and how dependent the skill is on the length of the provided training period. Additionally, we show that using the neural networks to reproduce the climate of general circulation models including a seasonal cycle remains challenging – in contrast to earlier promising results on a model without seasonal cycle.},

	abstract = {The properties of Earth's albedo and its symmetries are analyzed using twenty years of space‐based Energy Balanced And Filled product of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System measurements. Despite surface asymmetries, top of the atmosphere temporally \& hemispherically averaged reflected solar irradiance R appears symmetric over Northern/Southern hemispheres. This is confirmed with the use of surrogate time‐series, which provides margins of 0.1±0.28Wm−2 for possible hemispheric differences supported by Clouds and Earth's Radiant System data. R time‐series are further analyzed by decomposition into a seasonal (yearly and half yearly) cycle and residuals. Variability in the reflected solar irradiance is almost entirely (99\%) due to the seasonal variations, mostly due to seasonal variations in insolation. The residuals of hemispherically averaged R are not only small, but also indistinguishable from noise, and thus not correlated across hemispheres. This makes yearly and sub‐yearly timescales unlikely as the basis for a symmetry‐establishing mechanism. The residuals however contain a global trend that is large, as compared to expected albedo feedbacks. It is also hemispherically symmetric, and thus indicates the possibility of a symmetry enforcing mechanism at longer timescales. To pinpoint precisely which parts of the Earth system establish the hemispheric symmetry, we create an energetically consistent cloud‐albedo field from the data. We show that the surface albedo asymmetry is compensated by asymmetries between clouds over extra‐tropical oceans, with southern hemispheric storm‐tracks being 11\% cloudier than their northern hemisphere counterparts. This again indicates that, assuming the albedo symmetry is not a result of chance, its mechanism likely operates on large temporal and spatial scales. The planetary albedo is the portion of solar radiation reflected by the planet back to space, and is a prime factor deciding whether the planet will warm or cool over time. An intriguing property of the albedo is that, on average, Northern or Southern Hemisphere (NH or SH) have the same albedo, called hemispheric symmetry. The symmetry is surprising, because SH has much more ocean than land, and ocean is less reflective than land, so NH should have higher albedo. Nevertheless, clouds, which also tune the albedo, compensate the surface albedo imbalances of the two hemispheres, leading to an overall symmetric albedo. It is so far unclear how, or why, clouds perform this compensation. Here we show that this cloud compensation comes from the extra‐tropical storm tracks of the SH, which are cloudier than those of the NH. We further analyze satellite radiation measurements in search of indicators of a process between NH and SH which establishes the albedo symmetry. While we find reflected radiation timeseries to be mostly a seasonal cycle superimposed with small noise, we also see that reflection decreases overtime with a significant trend that is identical for both hemispheres and thus hints at some interaction mechanism. Surrogate time‐series analysis establishes the hemispheric albedo symmetry and excludes potential mechanisms enforcing it Decadal trends in reflected insolation, while substantial, do not break Earth's hemispheric albedo symmetry Hemispheric clear‐sky albedo asymmetries are balanced by hemispheric asymmetries in extra‐tropical storm‐track cloudiness Surrogate time‐series analysis establishes the hemispheric albedo symmetry and excludes potential mechanisms enforcing it Decadal trends in reflected insolation, while substantial, do not break Earth's hemispheric albedo symmetry Hemispheric clear‐sky albedo asymmetries are balanced by hemispheric asymmetries in extra‐tropical storm‐track cloudiness},

Our focus is on identifying the regimes and regions where the aerosol indirect effects (AIEs) are evident in long-term averages over the global oceans through analyzing the correlation features between aerosol loading and the key cloud variables including cloud droplet effective radius (CDER), cloud optical depth (COD), cloud water path (CWP), cloud top height (CTH), and cloud top temperature (CTT). An aerosol optical thickness (AOT) range of 0.13 {\textless} AOT {\textless} 0.3 is identified as the sensitive regime of the conventional first AIE where CDER is more susceptible to AOT than the other cloud variables. The first AIE that manifests as the change of long-term averaged CDER appears only in limited oceanic regions. The signature of aerosol invigoration of water clouds as revealed by the increase of cloud cover fraction (CCF) and CTH with increasing AOT at the middle/high latitudes of both hemispheres is identified for a pristine atmosphere (AOT {\textless} 0.08). Aerosol invigoration signature is also revealed by the concurrent increase of CDER, COD, and CWP with increasing AOT for a polluted marine atmosphere (AOT {\textgreater} 0.3) in the tropical convergence zones. The regions where the second AIE is likely to manifest in the CCF change are limited to several oceanic areas with high CCF of the warm water clouds near the western coasts of continents. The second AIE signature as represented by the reduction of the precipitation efficiency with increasing AOT is more likely to be observed in the AOT regime of 0.08 {\textless} AOT {\textless} 0.4. The corresponding AIE active regions manifested themselves as the decline of the precipitation efficiency are mainly limited to the oceanic areas downwind of continental aerosols. The sensitive regime of the conventional AIE identified in this observational study is likely associated with the transitional regime from the aerosol-limited regime to the updraft-limited regime identified for aerosol-cloud interaction in cloud model simulations.},

There is currently high variance among the predictions of 20 global climate models, from various laboratories around the world, that inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Given temperature predictions from 20 IPCC global climate models, and over 100 years of historical temperature data, we track the changing sequence of which model predicts best at any given time. We use an algorithm due to Monteleoni and Jaakkola that models the sequence of observations using a hierarchical learner, based on a set of generalized Hidden Markov Models, where the identity of the current best climate model is the hidden variable. The transition probabilities between climate models are learned online, simultaneous to tracking the temperature predictions. On historical global mean temperature data, our online learning algorithm's average prediction loss nearly matches that of the best performing climate model in hindsight. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of the average model prediction, which is the default practice in climate science, the median prediction, and least squares linear regression. We also experimented on climate model predictions through the year 2098. Simulating labels with the predictions of any one climate model, we found significantly improved performance using our online learning algorithm with respect to the other climate models and techniques. To complement our global results, we also ran experiments on IPCC global climate model temperature predictions for the specific geographic regions of Africa, Europe, and North America. On historical data, at both annual and monthly time-scales, and in future simulations, our algorithm typically outperformed both the best climate model per region and linear regression.

How this cooling effect will respond to climate change is a leading source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, the planetary warming resulting from CO2 doubling. Here, we observationally constrain this low cloud feedback at a near-global scale. Satellite observations are used to estimate the sensitivity of low clouds to interannual meteorological perturbations. Combined with model predictions of meteorological changes under greenhouse warming, this permits quantification of spatially resolved cloud feedbacks. We predict positive feedbacks from midlatitude low clouds and eastern ocean stratocumulus, nearly unchanged trade cumulus and a near-global marine low cloud feedback of 0.19 ± 0.12 W m−2 K−1 (90\% confidence). These constraints imply a moderate climate sensitivity ({\textasciitilde}3 K). Despite improved midlatitude cloud feedback simulation by several current-generation climate models, their erroneously positive trade cumulus feedbacks produce unrealistically high climate sensitivities. Conversely, models simulating erroneously weak low cloud feedbacks produce unrealistically low climate sensitivities. Marine low clouds cool the planet, but their response to warming is uncertain and dominates the spread in model-based climate sensitivities. Observational constraints suggest smaller cloud feedbacks than previously reported and imply a more moderate climate sensitivity.},

The Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) endorsed by CMIP6 seeks to provide a foundation for answering the question through three related activities: (i) accurate characterization of the effective radiative forcing relative to a near-preindustrial baseline and careful diagnosis of the components of this forcing; (ii) assessment of the absolute accuracy of clear-sky radiative transfer parameterizations against reference models on the global scales relevant for climate modeling; and (iii) identification of robust model responses to tightly specified aerosol radiative forcing from 1850 to present. Complete characterization of effective radiative forcing can be accomplished with 180 years (Tier 1) of atmosphere-only simulation using a sea-surface temperature and sea ice concentration climatology derived from the host model's preindustrial control simulation. Assessment of parameterization error requires trivial amounts of computation but the development of small amounts of infrastructure: new, spectrally detailed diagnostic output requested as two snapshots at present-day and preindustrial conditions, and results from the model's radiation code applied to specified atmospheric conditions. The search for robust responses to aerosol changes relies on the CMIP6 specification of anthropogenic aerosol properties; models using this specification can contribute to RFMIP with no additional simulation, while those using a full aerosol model are requested to perform at least one and up to four 165-year coupled ocean–atmosphere simulations at Tier 1.},

However, much of the information gained from running large ensembles is lost in traditional methods of data reduction such as linear trend analysis or large-scale spatial averaging. This paper demonstrates how a pattern recognition method (signal-to-noise-maximizing pattern filtering) extracts patterns of externally forced climate change from large ensembles and identifies the forced climate response with up to ten times fewer ensemble members than simple ensemble averaging. It is particularly effective at filtering out spatially coherent modes of internal variability (e.g., El Niño, North Atlantic Oscillation), which would otherwise alias into estimates of regional responses to forcing. This method is used to identify forced climate responses within the 40-member Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble, including an El-Niño-like response to volcanic eruptions and forced trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation. The ensemble-based estimate of the forced response is used to test statistical methods for isolating the forced response from a single realization (i.e., individual ensemble members). Low-frequency pattern filtering is found to skillfully identify the forced response within individual ensemble members and is applied to the HadCRUT4 reconstruction of observed temperatures, whereby it identifies slow components of observed temperature changes that are consistent with the expected effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Nudging as an assimilation technique has seen increased use in recent years in the development and evaluation of climate models. Constraining the simulated wind and temperature fields using global weather reanalysis facilitates more straightforward comparison between simulation and observation, and reduces uncertainties associated with natural variabilities of the large-scale circulation. On the other hand, the forcing introduced by nudging can be strong enough to change the basic characteristics of the model climate. In the paper we show that for the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), due to the systematic temperature bias in the standard model and the sensitivity of simulated ice formation to anthropogenic aerosol concentration, nudging towards reanalysis results in substantial reductions in the ice cloud amount and the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on long-wave cloud forcing. In order to reduce discrepancies between the nudged and unconstrained simulations, and meanwhile take the advantages of nudging, two alternative experimentation methods are evaluated. The first one constrains only the horizontal winds. The second method nudges both winds and temperature, but replaces the long-term climatology of the reanalysis by that of the model. Results show that both methods lead to substantially improved agreement with the free-running model in terms of the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget and cloud ice amount. The wind-only nudging is more convenient to apply, and provides higher correlations of the wind fields, geopotential height and specific humidity between simulation and reanalysis. Results from both CAM5 and a second aerosol–climate model ECHAM6-HAM2 also indicate that compared to the wind-and-temperature nudging, constraining only winds leads to better agreement with the free-running model in terms of the estimated shortwave cloud forcing and the simulated convective activities. This suggests nudging the horizontal winds but not temperature is a good strategy for the investigation of aerosol indirect effects since it provides well-constrained meteorology without strongly perturbing the model's mean climate.},

Here, we develop a technique which combines statistical emulation with a dimensionality reduction technique to emulate a wide range of outputs from an atmospheric general circulation model, PLASIM, as functions of the boundary forcing prescribed by the ocean component of a lower complexity climate model, GENIE-1. Although accurate and detailed spatial information on atmospheric variables such as precipitation and wind speed is well beyond the capability of GENIE-1’s energy-moisture balance model of the atmosphere, this study demonstrates that the output of this model is useful in predicting PLASIM’s spatio-temporal fields through multi-level emulation. Meaningful information from the fast model, GENIE-1 was extracted by utilising the correlation between variables of the same type in the two models and between variables of different types in PLASIM.

Synergistically these data characterize boundary layer and free troposphere environmental properties, and represent the most comprehensive data of this type available south of the oceanic polar front, in the cold sector of SO cyclones, and across seasons. Results show a largely pristine environments with numerous small and few large aerosols above cloud, suggesting new particle formation and limited long-range transport from continents, high variability in CCN and cloud droplet concentrations, and ubiquitous supercooled water in thin, multi-layered clouds, often with small-scale generating cells near cloud top. These observations demonstrate how cloud properties depend on aerosols while highlighting the importance of confirmed low clouds were responsible for radiation biases. The combination of models and observations is examining how aerosols and meteorology couple to control SO water and energy budgets.},

	abstract = {Global mean surface temperature change over the past 120 years resembles a rising staircase. Simulations with a coupled ocean–atmosphere model reveal that the tropical Pacific Ocean is the pacemaker of variable warming rates. Global mean surface temperature change over the past 120 years resembles a rising staircase1,2: the overall warming trend was interrupted by the mid-twentieth-century big hiatus and the warming slowdown2,3,4,5,6,7,8 since about 1998. The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation9,10 has been implicated in modulations of global mean surface temperatures6,11, but which part of the mode drives the variability in warming rates is unclear. Here we present a successful simulation of the global warming staircase since 1900 with a global ocean–atmosphere coupled model where tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures are forced to follow the observed evolution. Without prescribed tropical Pacific variability, the same model, on average, produces a continual warming trend that accelerates after the 1960s. We identify four events where the tropical Pacific decadal cooling markedly slowed down the warming trend. Matching the observed spatial and seasonal fingerprints we identify the tropical Pacific as a key pacemaker of the warming staircase, with radiative forcing driving the overall warming trend. Specifically, tropical Pacific variability amplifies the first warming epoch of the 1910s–1940s and determines the timing when the big hiatus starts and ends. Our method of removing internal variability from the observed record can be used for real-time monitoring of anthropogenic warming.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 ∘C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.},

	abstract = {Variability in the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) can influence the tropospheric circulation and thereby winter weather. Early predictions of extreme SPV states are thus important to improve forecasts of winter weather including cold spells. However, dynamical models are usually restricted in lead time because they poorly capture low‐frequency processes. Empirical models often suffer from overfitting problems as the relevant physical processes and time lags are often not well understood. Here we introduce a novel empirical prediction method by uniting a response‐guided community detection scheme with a causal discovery algorithm. This way, we objectively identify causal precursors of the SPV at subseasonal lead times and find them to be in good agreement with known physical drivers. A linear regression prediction model based on the causal precursors can explain most SPV variability (r2 = 0.58), and our scheme correctly predicts 58\% (46\%) of extremely weak SPV states for lead times of 1–15 (16–30) days with false‐alarm rates of only approximately 5\%. Our method can be applied to any variable relevant for (sub)seasonal weather forecasts and could thus help improving long‐lead predictions. A new scheme to detect causal precursors useful for empirical predictions is introduced Subseasonal causal precursors of the stratospheric polar vortex are identified Enables skillful predictions of extremely weak and strong vortex states at long lead times},

Thus, if SRM were used to offset all CO2‐induced mean warming, global‐mean precipitation would be less than in an unperturbed climate. Here, we show that the mismatch between the mean hydrological effects of CO2 and SRM may partly be alleviated by spectrally tuning the SRM intervention (reducing insolation at some wavelengths more than others). By concentrating solar dimming at near‐infrared wavelengths, where H2O has strong absorption bands, the direct effect of CO2 on the tropospheric energy budget can be offset, which minimizes perturbations to the mean hydrological cycle. Idealized cloud‐resolving simulations of radiative‐convective equilibrium confirm that spectrally tuned SRM can simultaneously maintain mean surface temperature and precipitation at their unperturbed values even as large quantities of CO2 are added to the atmosphere. It may be possible to partly counteract CO2‐driven climate change by solar radiation modification (SRM) that intentionally reduces the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth. But different wavelengths of the solar spectrum are absorbed at different altitudes within the surface‐atmosphere system, so different climatic effects are to be expected depending on which wavelengths of sunlight are affected by an SRM intervention. Here, we show that if the goal is to minimize perturbations to the mean hydrological cycle, the ideal spectrally tuned SRM intervention may need to focus on near‐infrared wavelengths. This study clarifies the basic physics underlying the effects of SRM on atmospheric energetics and the mean hydrological cycle.

The goal for this study is to determine a global spatial distribution of aerosol mixing state with respect to hygroscopicity, as quantified by the mixing state metric χ . In this way, areas can be identified where the external or internal mixture assumption is more appropriate. We used the output of a large ensemble of particle-resolved box model simulations in conjunction with machine learning techniques to train a model of the mixing state metric χ . This lower-order model for χ uses as inputs only variables known to GCMs, enabling us to create a global map of χ based on GCM data. We found that χ varied between 20\% and nearly 100\%, and we quantified how this depended on particle diameter, location, and time of the year. This framework demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to bridge the gap between detailed process modeling and a large-scale climate model.},

These model-measurement intercomparisons include BC surface and aircraft concentrations, aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) retrievals from AERONET and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and BC column estimations based on AERONET. In regions other than Asia, most models are biased high compared to surface concentration measurements. However compared with (column) AAOD or BC burden retreivals, the models are generally biased low. The average ratio of model to retrieved AAOD is less than 0.7 in South American and 0.6 in African biomass burning regions; both of these regions lack surface concentration measurements. In Asia the average model to observed ratio is 0.7 for AAOD and 0.5 for BC surface concentrations. Compared with aircraft measurements over the Americas at latitudes between 0 and 50N, the average model is a factor of 8 larger than observed, and most models exceed the measured BC standard deviation in the mid to upper troposphere. At higher latitudes the average model to aircraft BC ratio is 0.4 and models underestimate the observed BC loading in the lower and middle troposphere associated with springtime Arctic haze. Low model bias for AAOD but overestimation of surface and upper atmospheric BC concentrations at lower latitudes suggests that most models are underestimating BC absorption and should improve estimates for refractive index, particle size, and optical effects of BC coating. Retrieval uncertainties and/or differences with model diagnostic treatment may also contribute to the model-measurement disparity. Largest AeroCom model diversity occurred in northern Eurasia and the remote Arctic, regions influenced by anthropogenic sources. Changing emissions, aging, removal, or optical properties within a single model generated a smaller change in model predictions than the range represented by the full set of AeroCom models. Upper tropospheric concentrations of BC mass from the aircraft measurements are suggested to provide a unique new benchmark to test scavenging and vertical dispersion of BC in global models.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

After being trained on the model, the network can predict the complete model state several time steps ahead—which conceptually is making weather forecasts in the model world. Additionally, after being initialized with an arbitrary model state, the network can through repeatedly feeding back its predictions into its inputs create a climate run, which has similar climate statistics to the climate of the general circulation model. This network climate run shows no long‐term drift, even though no conservation properties were explicitly designed into the network. Numerical weather prediction and climate models are complex computer programs that represent the physics of the atmosphere. They are essential tools for predicting the weather and for studying the Earth's climate. Recently, a lot of progress has been made in machine learning methods. These are data‐driven algorithms that learn from existing data. We show that it is possible that such an algorithm learns the dynamics of a simple climate model. After being presented with enough data from the climate model, the network can successfully predict the time evolution of the model's state, thus replacing the dynamics of the model. This finding is an important step toward purely data‐driven weather forecasting—thus weather forecasting without the use of traditional numerical models and also opens up new possibilities for climate modeling.

	abstract = {A promising approach to improve climate‐model simulations is to replace traditional subgrid parameterizations based on simplified physical models by machine learning algorithms that are data‐driven. However, neural networks (NNs) often lead to instabilities and climate drift when coupled to an atmospheric model. Here, we learn an NN parameterization from a high‐resolution atmospheric simulation in an idealized domain by accurately calculating subgrid terms through coarse graining. The NN parameterization has a structure that ensures physical constraints are respected, such as by predicting subgrid fluxes instead of tendencies. The NN parameterization leads to stable simulations that replicate the climate of the high‐resolution simulation with similar accuracy to a successful random‐forest parameterization while needing far less memory. We find that the simulations are stable for different horizontal resolutions and a variety of NN architectures, and that an NN with substantially reduced numerical precision could decrease computational costs without affecting the quality of simulations. Due to computational resource limits, small‐scale processes, such as clouds and convection, are not explicitly included in state‐of‐the‐art global climate models. Yet, these processes are crucial for accurate predictions of climate, and therefore the effect of these processes on the climate system needs to be estimated using parameterizations. Traditional parameterizations usually rely on simplified models and suffer from inaccuracies that lead to large uncertainties in climate projections. One alternative to traditional parameterizations is to use machine learning to learn new parameterizations which are data driven. However, neural‐network parameterizations often lead to instability when implemented in an atmospheric model. Here, we learn a neural‐network parameterization that incorporates physical constraints and show that when this parameterization is coupled to an atmospheric model it leads to stable simulations that can mimic the climate of a high‐resolution simulation. Furthermore, we show that a neural‐network parameterization with reduced numerical precision has the potential to reduce the computational cost of running simulations without having a large impact on the quality of simulations. Overall, our results provide a step forward toward a stable, accurate, and computationally affordable neural‐network parameterization of atmospheric subgrid processes for use in simulations of climate.

	abstract = {Are convective clouds strengthened by the addition of aerosol particles? We present new theoretical calculations which starkly contrast previous results. Prior foundational work suggested that aerosols strongly invigorate convective cloud updrafts via changes to cold‐phase processes. We show that the peak magnitude of invigoration by this mechanism is substantially reduced for cold‐based storms. For warm‐based storms, the updrafts are weakened, not strengthened, by aerosol‐induced changes to cold‐phase processes. Our calculations show that if invigoration occurs, it is driven primarily by changes to warm‐phase processes and may be largest well before the storm reaches maturity. The calculations are based on a new formulation of the moist adiabatic lapse rate that accounts for freezing, supersaturation, and condensate loading. The results significantly reshape our understanding of the impact of aerosols on convective updrafts. Storms which ingest additional aerosol particles are thought to develop stronger updrafts due to changes in the rates of condensation and freezing of water. We use theoretical calculations to understand the mechanisms that drive this response. Unlike previous studies, we find that aerosol‐induced changes to freezing result in weaker storms if the storms have relatively warm cloud bases. Consistent with previous studies, changes to condensation result in stronger storms, but we are the first to theoretically quantify the magnitude of this mechanism. These results suggest that developing storms in polluted environments may often be strongest compared to their clean counterparts well below storm top.

While the overall features are broadly similar between models, we find significant regional intermodel variability, especially over land. Black carbon stands out as a component that may cause significant model diversity in predicted precipitation change.

	abstract = {Monte Carlo and Morris screening techniques are used to examine the relative sensitivity of deep convective simulations to changes in initial conditions (IC) versus changes to microphysical parameters (MP). IC are perturbed using a set of empirical orthogonal function – principal component pairs obtained from a database of tropical soundings, while MP are perturbed consistent with their range of realistic values. Monte Carlo experiments provide a broad overview of parameter – output response, while Morris screening techniques identify the most significant influences on specific model output variables. Changes to MP produce a similar order of magnitude response in convective hydrologic cycle, dynamics, and latent heating as changes to IC. Changes in IC appear to have a larger effect on radiative fluxes than perturbations to MP. The distribution of low-level latent heating reveals that changes in MP have a larger influence on cold pool properties than changes to the environment. The dominant effects are produced by a subset of cloud MP and thermodynamic structure functions, indicating perturbation of a subset of the control factors may be used to produce most of the variability in a short-term convective-scale ensemble forecast. The most influential MP are the autoconversion threshold, the rain particle size distribution intercept, and the ice particle fall speed parameters. The most influential EOFs are those that correspond to variability in lower-to-middle tropospheric temperature and water vapor, as well as zonal low level shear. The results have implications for both the understanding of what influences convective development, as well as the design of ensemble-based prediction and data assimilation systems.},

	abstract = {Aerosol–cloud interactions represent the leading uncertainty in our ability to infer climate sensitivity from the observational record. The forcing from changes in cloud albedo driven by increases in cloud droplet number (Nd) (the first indirect effect) is confidently negative and has narrowed its probable range in the last decade, but the sign and strength of forcing associated with changes in cloud macrophysics in response to aerosol (aerosol–cloud adjustments) remain uncertain. This uncertainty reflects our inability to accurately quantify variability not associated with a causal link flowing from the cloud microphysical state to the cloud macrophysical state. Once variability associated with meteorology has been removed, covariance between the liquid water path (LWP) averaged across cloudy and clear regions (here characterizing the macrophysical state) and Nd (characterizing the microphysical) is the sum of two causal pathways linking Nd to LWP: Nd altering LWP (adjustments) and precipitation scavenging aerosol and thus depleting Nd. Only the former term is relevant to constraining adjustments, but disentangling these terms in observations is challenging. We hypothesize that the diversity of constraints on aerosol–cloud adjustments in the literature may be partly due to not explicitly characterizing covariance flowing from cloud to aerosol and aerosol to cloud. Here, we restrict our analysis to the regime of extratropical clouds outside of low-pressure centers associated with cyclonic activity. Observations from MAC-LWP (Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path) and MODIS are compared to simulations in the Met Office Unified Model (UM) GA7.1 (the atmosphere model of HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1). The meteorological predictors of LWP are found to be similar between the model and observations. There is also agreement with previous literature on cloud-controlling factors finding that increasing stability, moisture, and sensible heat flux enhance LWP, while increasing subsidence and sea surface temperature decrease it. A simulation where cloud microphysics are insensitive to changes in Nd is used to characterize covariance between Nd and LWP that is induced by factors other than aerosol–cloud adjustments. By removing variability associated with meteorology and scavenging, we infer the sensitivity of LWP to changes in Nd. Application of this technique to UM GA7.1 simulations reproduces the true model adjustment strength. Observational constraints developed using simulated covariability not induced by adjustments and observed covariability between Nd and LWP predict a 25 \%–30 \% overestimate by the UM GA7.1 in LWP change and a 30 \%–35 \% overestimate in associated radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Providing reliable information on climate change at local scale remains a challenge of first importance for impact studies and policymakers. Here, we propose a novel hybrid downscaling method combining the strengths of both empirical statistical downscaling methods and Regional Climate Models (RCMs). In the longer term, the final aim of this tool is to enlarge the high-resolution RCM simulation ensembles at low cost to explore better the various sources of projection uncertainty at local scale. Using a neural network, we build a statistical RCM-emulator by estimating the downscaling function included in the RCM. This framework allows us to learn the relationship between large-scale predictors and a local surface variable of interest over the RCM domain in present and future climate. The RCM-emulator developed in this study is trained to produce daily maps of the near-surface temperature at the RCM resolution (12 km). The emulator demonstrates an excellent ability to reproduce the complex spatial structure and daily variability simulated by the RCM, particularly how the RCM refines the low-resolution climate patterns. Training in future climate appears to be a key feature of our emulator. Moreover, there is a substantial computational benefit of running the emulator rather than the RCM, since training the emulator takes about 2 h on GPU, and the prediction takes less than a minute. However, further work is needed to improve the reproduction of some temperature extremes, the climate change intensity and extend the proposed methodology to different regions, GCMs, RCMs, and variables of interest.},

	abstract = {Precipitation plays a crucial role in the Earth's energy balance, the water cycle, and the global atmospheric circulation. Aerosols, by direct interaction with radiation and by serving as cloud condensation nuclei, may affect clouds and rain formation. This effect can be examined in terms of energetic constraints, that is, any aerosol‐driven diabatic heating/cooling of the atmosphere will have to be balanced by changes in precipitation, radiative fluxes, or divergence of dry static energy. Using an aqua‐planet general circulation model (GCM), we show that tropical and extratropical precipitation have contrasting responses to aerosol perturbations. This behavior can be explained by contrasting ability of the atmosphere to diverge excess dry static energy in the two different regions. It is shown that atmospheric heating in the tropics leads to large‐scale thermally driven circulation and a large increase in precipitation, while the excess energy from heating in the extratropics is constrained due to the effect of the Coriolis force, causing the precipitation to decrease. Precipitation, as the Earth's only natural source of fresh water, is of great importance for society. Climate change, besides changing the mean surface temperature and its distribution, is expected to change the precipitation's temporal and spatial distribution and, to a lesser extent, the global mean precipitation. One important agent in precipitation changes is anthropogenic aerosols. In this paper we study the response of precipitation to aerosol perturbations at different latitudes. Previously, it was proposed that aerosols drive a slowdown of the hydrological cycle. In addition, it was shown that, due to energy budget conservation, absorbing aerosols leads to a reduction in the global mean precipitation. Here we show that the response in the tropics is the opposite of the global mean response and of the extratropical response. Specifically, we show that the same aerosol perturbation generally increases precipitation in the tropics and decreases precipitation in the extratropics. This behavior can be explained by the contrasting ability of the atmosphere to diverge excess dry static energy in the tropics and extratropics. We also show that local aerosol perturbations could affect precipitation in remote regions due to a formation of large‐scale circulation.

Measurements of aerosol properties at a second, lower site, Schilthorn, Switzerland, were used as input for a primary ice nucleation scheme to predict ice nuclei concentrations at Jungfraujoch. Frequent, rapid transitions in the ice and liquid properties of the clouds at Jungfraujoch were identified that led to large fluctuations in ice mass fractions over temporal scales of seconds to hours. During the measurement period we observed high concentrations of ice particles that exceeded 1000 L$^{\textrm{−1}}$ at temperatures around −15 °C, verified by multiple instruments. These concentrations could not be explained using the usual primary ice nucleation schemes, which predicted ice nucleus concentrations several orders of magnitude smaller than the peak ice crystal number concentrations. Secondary ice production through the Hallett–Mossop process as a possible explanation was ruled out, as the cloud was rarely within the active temperature range for this process. It is shown that other mechanisms of secondary ice particle production cannot explain the highest ice particle concentrations. We describe four possible mechanisms that could lead to high cloud ice concentrations generated from the snow-covered surfaces surrounding the measurement site. Of these we show that hoar frost crystals generated at the cloud enveloped snow surface could be the most important source of cloud ice concentrations. Blowing snow was also observed to make significant contributions at higher wind speeds when ice crystal concentrations were {\textless} 100 L$^{\textrm{−1}}$.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) is of central interest to improve the understanding of cloud physics and for quantifying the effective radiative forcing by aerosol‐cloud interactions. Current standard satellite retrievals do not operationally provide Nd, but it can be inferred from retrievals of cloud optical depth (τc) cloud droplet effective radius (re) and cloud top temperature. This review summarizes issues with this approach and quantifies uncertainties. A total relative uncertainty of 78\% is inferred for pixel‐level retrievals for relatively homogeneous, optically thick and unobscured stratiform clouds with favorable viewing geometry. The uncertainty is even greater if these conditions are not met. For averages over 1° ×1° regions the uncertainty is reduced to 54\% assuming random errors for instrument uncertainties. In contrast, the few evaluation studies against reference in situ observations suggest much better accuracy with little variability in the bias. More such studies are required for a better error characterization. Nd uncertainty is dominated by errors in re, and therefore, improvements in re retrievals would greatly improve the quality of the Nd retrievals. Recommendations are made for how this might be achieved. Some existing Nd data sets are compared and discussed, and best practices for the use of Nd data from current passive instruments (e.g., filtering criteria) are recommended. Emerging alternative Nd estimates are also considered. First, new ideas to use additional information from existing and upcoming spaceborne instruments are discussed, and second, approaches using high‐quality ground‐based observations are examined. Clouds have a very large influence on weather and climate. It is thus a prime task for satellite‐ and ground‐based observations to measure clouds. For satellites and many other instruments this is done by remote sensing—radiation is measured, and knowledge about clouds is inferred. Liquid water clouds consist of numerous droplets of order of 10 μm in size. A key quantity that describes clouds is the number of droplets in a given volume or the droplet number concentration. However, satellite observations of droplet number concentration are only emerging, and the quality of these observations is poorly known. This review fulfills two tasks, namely, (1) to quantify how uncertain the current way to observe droplet number concentrations from satellite is and (2) to propose ways toward better approaches. It is concluded that the current way to obtain cloud droplet number concentration works for homogeneous stratus and stratocumulus clouds, with, however, a substantial error of around 50\%. For cumulus clouds the observations are substantially worse. New avenues that are proposed for a better estimate of cloud droplet concentration exploit instruments that emit light (lidar) or microwaves (radar), and measure the reflected signal, or explore the polarization of light induced by clouds. Satellite cloud droplet concentration uncertainties of 78\% for pixel‐level retrievals and 54\% for 1 by 1 degree retrievals are estimated The effective radius retrieval is the most important aspect for improvement, and more in situ evaluation is needed Potential improvements using passive and active satellite, and ground‐based instruments are discussed},

The method exploits a geometrical approach to Bayesian inference and is designed to be fast, to facilitate detailed diagnostic checking of our emulators by allowing us to carry out many analyses very quickly. Our motivating application involved constructing an emulator for the UK Met Office Hadley Centre coupled climate model HadCM3 as a function of carbon dioxide forcing, which was part of a ‘RAPID’ programme deliverable to the UK Met Office funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.

This reduction in droplet size causes the reflectivity at 3.7 micrometers to be greater than the levels for nearby noncontaminated clouds of similar physical characteristics. The increase in droplet number causes the reflectivity at 0.63 micrometer to be significantly higher for the contaminated clouds despite the likelihood that the exhaust is a source of particles that absorb at visible wavelengths.

This simulation was performed as part of the DYnamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled On Non‐hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) Phase 2 model intercomparison. Effective resolution is found to be the horizontal dynamics grid resolution despite using a coarser grid for physical parameterizations. Despite this new model being in an immature and untuned state, moving to 3.25 km grid spacing solves several long‐standing problems with the E3SM model. In particular, Amazon precipitation is much more realistic, the frequency of light and heavy precipitation is improved, agreement between the simulated and observed diurnal cycle of tropical precipitation is excellent, and the vertical structure of tropical convection and coastal stratocumulus look good. In addition, the new model is able to capture the frequency and structure of important weather events (e.g., tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones including atmospheric rivers, and cold air outbreaks). Interestingly, this model does not get rid of the erroneous southern branch of the intertropical convergence zone nor the tendency for strongest convection to occur over the Maritime Continent rather than the West Pacific, both of which are classic climate model biases. Several other problems with the simulation are identified, underscoring the fact that this model is a work in progress. This paper describes the new global 3.25 km version of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) atmosphere model and its behavior in a 40‐day northern‐hemisphere wintertime simulation. In exchange for huge computational expense, this high‐resolution model avoids many but not all biases common in lower‐resolution models.

Mean observed OA concentrations range from 0.2–8.2 μg sm−3 and make up 15 to 70\% of non-refractory aerosol. The standard GEOS-Chem simulation reproduces the observed vertical profile, although observations are underestimated in 13 of the 17 field campaigns (the median observed to simulated ratio ranges from 0.4 to 4.2), with the largest model bias in anthropogenic regions. However, the model is best able to capture the observed variability in these anthropogenically-influenced regions (R2=0.18−0.57), but has little skill in remote or fire-influenced regions. The model bias increases as a function of relative humidity for 11 of the campaigns, possibly indicative of missing aqueous phase SOA production. However, model simulations of aqueous phase SOA suggest a pronounced signature in the mid-troposphere (2–6 km) which is not supported in the observations examined here. Spracklen et al. (2011) suggest adding {\textasciitilde}100 Tg yr−1 source of anthropogenically-controlled SOA to close the measurement-model gap, which we add as anthropogenic SOA. This eliminates the model underestimate near source, but leads to overestimates aloft in a few regions and in remote regions, suggesting either additional sinks of OA or higher volatility aerosol at colder temperatures. Sensitivity simulations indicate that fragmentation of organics upon either heterogeneous or gas-phase oxidation could be an important (missing) sink of OA in models, reducing the global SOA burden by 15\% and 47\% respectively. The best agreement with observations is obtained when the simulated anthropogenically-controlled SOA is increased to {\textasciitilde}100 Tg yr−1 accompanied by either a gas-phase fragmentation process or a reduction in the temperature dependence of the organic aerosol partitioning (by decreasing the enthalpy of vaporization from 42 kJ mol−1 to 25 kJ mol−1). These results illustrate that models may require both additional sources and additional sinks to capture the observed concentrations of organic aerosol.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of precipitation intensity is crucial for both human and natural systems, especially in a warming climate more prone to extreme precipitation. Yet, climate models fail to accurately predict precipitation intensity, particularly extremes. One missing piece of information in traditional climate model parameterizations is subgrid-scale cloud structure and organization, which affects precipitation intensity and stochasticity at coarse resolution. Here, using global storm-resolving simulations and machine learning, we show that, by implicitly learning subgrid organization, we can accurately predict precipitation variability and stochasticity with a low-dimensional set of latent variables. Using a neural network to parameterize coarse-grained precipitation, we find that the overall behavior of precipitation is reasonably predictable using large-scale quantities only; however, the neural network cannot predict the variability of precipitation (R2 ∼ 0.45) and underestimates precipitation extremes. The performance is significantly improved when the network is informed by our organization metric, correctly predicting precipitation extremes and spatial variability (R2 ∼ 0.9). The organization metric is implicitly learned by training the algorithm on a high-resolution precipitable water field, encoding the degree of subgrid organization. The organization metric shows large hysteresis, emphasizing the role of memory created by subgrid-scale structures. We demonstrate that this organization metric can be predicted as a simple memory process from information available at the previous time steps. These findings stress the role of organization and memory in accurate prediction of precipitation intensity and extremes and the necessity of parameterizing subgrid-scale convective organization in climate models to better project future changes of water cycle and extremes.},

Its goal was to better understand the factors driving current changes in Arctic atmospheric composition and climate, including (1) influx of mid-latitude pollution, (2) boreal forest fires, (3) aerosol radiative forcing, and (4) chemical processes. The June–July deployment was preceded by one week of flights over California (ARCTAS-CARB) focused on (1) improving state emission inventories for greenhouse gases and aerosols, (2) providing observations to test and improve models of ozone and aerosol pollution. ARCTAS involved three aircraft: a DC-8 with a detailed chemical payload, a P-3 with an extensive aerosol and radiometric payload, and a B-200 with aerosol remote sensing instrumentation. The aircraft data augmented satellite observations of Arctic atmospheric composition, in particular from the NASA A-Train. The spring phase (ARCTAS-A) revealed pervasive Asian pollution throughout the Arctic as well as significant European pollution below 2 km. Unusually large Siberian fires in April 2008 caused high concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols and also affected ozone. Satellite observations of BrO column hotspots were found not to be related to Arctic boundary layer events but instead to tropopause depressions, suggesting the presence of elevated inorganic bromine (5–10 pptv) in the lower stratosphere. Fresh fire plumes from Canada and California sampled during the summer phase (ARCTAS-B) indicated low NOx emission factors from the fires, rapid conversion of NOx to PAN, no significant secondary aerosol production, and no significant ozone enhancements except when mixed with urban pollution.},

A convolutional neural network was used to detect occurrences of pockets of open cells (POCs). Trained on a small hand‐logged data set and applied to 13 years of satellite imagery the neural network is able to classify 8,491 POCs. This extensive database allows the first robust analysis of the spatial and temporal prevalence of these phenomena, as well as a detailed analysis of their micro‐physical properties. We find a large (30\%) increase in cloud effective radius inside POCs as compared to their surroundings and similarly large (20\%) decrease in cloud fraction. This also allows their global radiative effect to be determined. Using simple radiative approximations we find that the instantaneous global annual mean top‐of‐atmosphere perturbation by all POCs is only 0.01 W/m2. The amount of sunlight that reaches, and warms, the surface of the earth is heavily influenced by clouds, in particular marine stratocumulus clouds, a type of low‐lying cloud that forms above cold‐upwelling regions of the ocean. Marine stratocumulus clouds form in two distinct regimes; open‐cells and closed‐cells. Closed‐cell clouds have a higher cloud cover and reflectivity than open‐cell clouds. Small pockets of open cell clouds sometimes form within larger regions of closed‐cell clouds; these are referred to as “pockets of open cells.” Here we use machine learning to detect occurrences of this phenomenon and characterize them in a long‐term satellite data set. This allows their effect on the climate to be determined for the first time. Despite substantial local‐scale changes in cloud properties, we find that their effect on the climate is small. Convolutional Neural Networks are used to detect 8,491 pockets of open cells in marine stratocumulus between 2005 and 2018 The first comprehensive analysis of their microphysical and climatological properties is presented Their global radiative effect is found to be negligible.

For an aerosol optical thickness of 0.6 located between 0 and 4 km, a cloud optical thickness of 9.0 and a cloud effective radius of 12.8 µm at 0.55 µm located between 1 and 2 km, the diurnally averaged RHR at noon in the aerosol layer increases from ∼6.6 K day−1 in June to ∼8.9 K day−1 in October. In June (October), the RHR in the cloud layer at noon is 1.3 (1.7) K day−1 higher than the case of pristine clouds. However, an elevated aerosol layer (2–4 km) reduces the RHR by ∼0.2 K day−1 in the cloud layer relative to a pristine cloudy case. The DRE at top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reaches its peak when the solar zenith angle (SZA) is 54°. The DRE increases (decreases) with SZA for SZA less (greater) than 54°. The primary peak DRE is ∼29.5 W m−2 at 5.0°S 5.0°E, occurring at 0800 UTC. At noon, the DRE at TOA is ∼18.9, ∼20.5 and ∼23.1 W m−2 at 5.0°S, 15.0°S and 25.0°S along 5.0°E, respectively.

	abstract = {Aerosol forcing uncertainty represents the largest climate forcing uncertainty overall. Its magnitude has remained virtually undiminished over the past 20 years despite considerable advances in understanding most of the key contributing elements. Recent work has produced modest increases only in the confidence of the uncertainty estimate itself. This review summarizes the contributions toward reducing the uncertainty in the aerosol forcing of climate made by satellite observations, measurements taken within the atmosphere, as well as modeling and data assimilation. We adopt a more measurement‐oriented perspective than most reviews of the subject in assessing the strengths and limitations of each; gaps and possible ways to fill them are considered. Currently planned programs supporting advanced, global‐scale satellite and surface‐based aerosol, cloud, and precursor gas observations, climate modeling, and intensive field campaigns aimed at characterizing the underlying physical and chemical processes involved, are all essential. But in addition, new efforts are needed: (a) to obtain systematic aircraft in situ measurements capturing the multi‐variate probability distribution functions of particle optical, microphysical, and chemical properties (and associated uncertainty estimates), as well as co‐variability with meteorology, for the major aerosol airmass types; (b) to conceive, develop, and implement a suborbital (aircraft plus surface‐based) program aimed at systematically quantifying the cloud‐scale microphysics, cloud optical properties, and cloud‐related vertical velocities associated with aerosol‐cloud interactions; and (c) to focus much more research on integrating the unique contributions of satellite observations, suborbital measurements, and modeling, to reduce the persistent uncertainty in aerosol climate forcing. Aerosols, such as airborne wildfire smoke, desert dust, volcanic and pollution particles, affect Earth's climate by reflecting (some also absorb) sunlight. These aerosol particles also play key roles in cloud formation and evolution, further affecting the planet's energy balance. The magnitudes of these effects, and even the underlying mechanisms, represent the largest uncertainty in climate modeling. Despite two decades of advances in many aspects of aerosol‐climate science, aerosol climate forcing uncertainty is virtually undiminished. Yet, reducing this uncertainty is critical for any effort to attribute, mitigate, or predict climate changes. We adopt a measurement‐oriented perspective to assess the strengths and limitations of measurement and modeling programs, and conclude that current and planned efforts need to continue. However, in addition, new efforts are needed: (a) to obtain aircraft in situ measurements that capture systematically aerosol particle properties for the major aerosol airmass types, globally, (b) to conceive, develop, and implement an aircraft and surface‐based program aimed at filling gaps in our understanding of the interactions between aerosol particles and clouds, along with (c) much more research focused on integrating the unique contributions of satellite observations, suborbital measurements, and modeling, to reduce the uncertainty in our understanding of Earth's changing climate.

Droplet nucleation is parameterized in terms of the parameters of a lognormal aerosol size distribution and in terms of a Gaussian probability distribution of vertical velocity within each grid cell. The predicted droplet number is found to be significantly less than observations unless vertical resolution provides at least 10 levels within the planetary boundary layer. When droplet number is simply diagnosed from the number nucleated, droplet concentrations are found to be consistently greater than with the predictive treatment. Predicted droplet number concentrations are found to be nonlinearly related to aerosol number concentration.},

Suppression of low-level rainout and aerosol washout allows transport of water and smoke to upper levels, where the clouds appear “smoking” as they detrain much of the pollution. Elevating the onset of precipitation allows invigoration of the updrafts, causing intense thunderstorms, large hail, and greater likelihood for overshooting cloud tops into the stratosphere. There, detrained pollutants and water vapor would have profound radiative impacts on the climate system. The invigorated storms release the latent heat higher in the atmosphere. This should substantially affect the regional and global circulation systems.

Calculations are based on the historical period and climate change scenarios. As in the observations the warming pattern contains a warming hole over the subpolar North Atlantic. Using a bivariate regression of SAT to GMT and an index of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the warming pattern is decomposed in a radiatively forced part and an AMOC fingerprint. The North Atlantic warming hole is associated with a decline of the AMOC. The AMOC fingerprint resembles Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), but details of the pattern change when the AMOC decline increases, underscoring the nonlinearity in the response. The warming hole is situated south of deep convection sites, indicating that it involves an adjustment of the gyre circulation, although it should be noted that some models feature deep convection in the middle of the subpolar gyre. The warming hole is already prominent in historical runs, where the response of the AMOC to GMT is weak, which suggests that it is involved in an ocean adjustment that precedes the AMOC decline. In the more strongly forced scenario runs, the warming hole over the subpolar gyre becomes weaker, while cooling over the Nordic seas increases, consistent with previous findings that deep convection in the Labrador and Irminger Seas is more vulnerable to changes in external forcing than convection in the Nordic seas, which only reacts after a threshold is passed.},

In this paper, we introduce model developments included in CLM version 5 (CLM5), which is the default land component for CESM2. We assess an ensemble of simulations, including prescribed and prognostic vegetation state, multiple forcing data sets, and CLM4, CLM4.5, and CLM5, against a range of metrics including from the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMBv2) package. CLM5 includes new and updated processes and parameterizations: (1) dynamic land units, (2) updated parameterizations and structure for hydrology and snow (spatially explicit soil depth, dry surface layer, revised groundwater scheme, revised canopy interception and canopy snow processes, updated fresh snow density, simple firn model, and Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport), (3) plant hydraulics and hydraulic redistribution, (4) revised nitrogen cycling (flexible leaf stoichiometry, leaf N optimization for photosynthesis, and carbon costs for plant nitrogen uptake), (5) global crop model with six crop types and time‐evolving irrigated areas and fertilization rates, (6) updated urban building energy, (7) carbon isotopes, and (8) updated stomatal physiology. New optional features include demographically structured dynamic vegetation model (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere. Conclusive establishment of improvement or degradation of individual variables or metrics is challenged by forcing uncertainty, parametric uncertainty, and model structural complexity, but the multivariate metrics presented here suggest a general broad improvement from CLM4 to CLM5. The Community Land Model (CLM) is the land component of the widely used Community Earth System Model (CESM). Here, we introduce model developments included in CLM version 5 (CLM5), the default land component for CESM2 which will be used for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). CLM5 includes many new and updated processes including (1) hydrology and snow features such as spatially explicit soil depth, canopy snow processes, a simple firn model, and a more mechanistic river model, (2) plant hydraulics and hydraulic redistribution, (3) revised nitrogen cycling with flexible leaf stoichiometry, leaf N optimization for photosynthesis, and carbon costs for plant nitrogen uptake, (4) expansion to six crop types (global) and time‐evolving irrigated areas and fertilization rates, (5) improved urban building energy model, and (6) carbon isotopes. New optional features include a demographically structured dynamic vegetation model, ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere. Model performance is generally improved for most assessed variables and metrics, though clear establishment of improvement or degradation is challenging due to model complexity as well as observational data limitations. Nonetheless, CLM5 is increasingly suited for research into a broad range of societally relevant scientific questions related to the terrestrial system. Updated Community Land Model has more hydrological and ecological process fidelity and more comprehensive representation of land management. The model is systematically evaluated using International Land Model Benchmarking system and shows marked improvement over prior versions.},

Machine learning (ML) systems, however, which depend strongly on properties of their inputs (e.g. the i.i.d. assumption), tend to fail silently. This paper explores the problem of building ML systems that fail loudly, investigating methods for detecting dataset shift, identifying exemplars that most typify the shift, and quantifying shift malignancy. We focus on several datasets and various perturbations to both covariates and label distributions with varying magnitudes and fractions of data affected. Interestingly, we show that across the dataset shifts that we explore, a two-sample-testing-based approach, using pre-trained classifiers for dimensionality reduction, performs best. Moreover, we demonstrate that domain-discriminating approaches tend to be helpful for characterizing shifts qualitatively and determining if they are harmful.},

	abstract = {The energy budgets over land and oceans are still afflicted with considerable uncertainties, despite their key importance for terrestrial and maritime climates. We evaluate these budgets as represented in 43 CMIP5 climate models with direct observations from both surface and space and identify substantial biases, particularly in the surface fluxes of downward solar and thermal radiation. These flux biases in the various models are then linearly related to their respective land and ocean means to infer best estimates for present day downward solar and thermal radiation over land and oceans. Over land, where most direct observations are available to constrain the surface fluxes, we obtain 184 and 306 Wm−2 for solar and thermal downward radiation, respectively. Over oceans, with weaker observational constraints, corresponding estimates are around 185 and 356 Wm−2. Considering additionally surface albedo and emissivity, we infer a surface absorbed solar and net thermal radiation of 136 and −66 Wm−2 over land, and 170 and −53 Wm−2 over oceans, respectively. The surface net radiation is thus estimated at 70 Wm−2 over land and 117 Wm−2 over oceans, which may impose additional constraints on the poorly known sensible/latent heat flux magnitudes, estimated here near 32/38 Wm−2 over land, and 16/100 Wm−2 over oceans. Estimated uncertainties are on the order of 10 and 5 Wm−2 for most surface and TOA fluxes, respectively. By combining these surface budgets with satellite-determined TOA budgets we quantify the atmospheric energy budgets as residuals (including ocean to land transports), and revisit the global mean energy balance.},

We compare microphysics observations between cases and with previous measurements made in the Arctic and Antarctic. During ACCACIA, stratocumulus clouds were observed to consist of liquid at cloud tops, often at distinct temperature inversions. The cloud top regions precipitated low concentrations of ice into the cloud below. During the spring cases median ice number concentrations ({\textasciitilde} 0.5 L$^{\textrm{−1}}$) were found to be lower by about a factor of 5 than observations from the summer campaign ({\textasciitilde} 3 L$^{\textrm{−1}}$). Cloud layers in the summer spanned a warmer temperature regime than in the spring and enhancement of ice concentrations in these cases was found to be due to secondary ice production through the Hallett–Mossop (H–M) process. Aerosol concentrations during spring ranged from {\textasciitilde} 300–400 cm$^{\textrm{−3}}$ in one case to lower values of {\textasciitilde} 50–100 cm$^{\textrm{−3}}$ in the other. The concentration of aerosol with sizes \textit{D}$_{\textrm{p}}$ {\textgreater} 0.5 μm was used in a primary ice nucleus (IN) prediction scheme (DeMott et al., 2010). Predicted IN values varied depending on aerosol measurement periods but were generally greater than maximum observed median values of ice crystal concentrations in the spring cases, and less than the observed ice concentrations in the summer due to the influence of secondary ice production. Comparison with recent cloud observations in the Antarctic summer (Grosvenor et al., 2012), reveals lower ice concentrations in Antarctic clouds in comparable seasons. An enhancement of ice crystal number concentrations (when compared with predicted IN numbers) was also found in Antarctic stratocumulus clouds spanning the H–M temperature zone; however, concentrations were about an order of magnitude lower than those observed in the Arctic summer cases but were similar to the peak values observed in the colder Arctic spring cases, where the H–M mechanism did not operate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

During the 21st century, North Atlantic and Southern Ocean OHU exhibit similarly positive trends under a business-as-usual scenario but respectively positive and negative trends under a mitigation scenario. The opposite centurial OHU trends in the Southern Ocean can be attributed partially to distinct GHG trajectories under the two scenarios while the common positive centurial OHU trends in the North Atlantic are mainly due to aerosol effects. Under both scenarios, projected decline of anthropogenic aerosols potentially induces a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and a divergence of meridional oceanic heat transport, which leads to enhanced OHU in the subpolar North Atlantic.},

	abstract = {Abstract The spectral long-wave feedback parameter represents how Earth’s outgoing long-wave radiation adjusts to temperature changes and directly impacts Earth’s climate sensitivity. Most research so far has focused on the spectral integral of the feedback parameter. Spectrally resolving the feedback parameter permits inferring information about the vertical distribution of long-wave feedbacks, thus gaining a better understanding of the underlying processes. However, investigations of the spectral long-wave feedback parameter have so far been limited mostly to model studies. Here we show that it is possible to directly observe the global mean all-sky spectral long-wave feedback parameter using satellite observations of seasonal and interannual variability. We find that spectral bands subject to strong water-vapour absorption exhibit a substantial stabilizing net feedback. We demonstrate that part of this stabilizing feedback is caused by the change of relative humidity with warming, the radiative fingerprints of which can be directly observed. Therefore, our findings emphasize the importance of better understanding processes affecting the present distribution and future trends in relative humidity. This observational constraint on the spectral long-wave feedback parameter can be used to evaluate the representation of long-wave feedbacks in global climate models and to better constrain Earth’s climate sensitivity.},

	abstract = {During July 2002, measurements of cloud condensation nuclei were made in the vicinity of southwest Florida as part of the Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers‐Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL‐FACE) field campaign. These observations, at supersaturations of 0.2 and 0.85\%, are presented here. The performance of each of the two CCN counters was validated through laboratory calibration and an in situ intercomparison. The measurements indicate that the aerosol sampled during the campaign was predominantly marine in character: the median concentrations were 233 cm−3 (at S = 0.2\%) and 371 cm−3 (at S = 0.85\%). Three flights during the experiment differed from this general trend; the aerosol sampled during the two flights on 18 July was more continental in character, and the observations on 28 July indicate high spatial variability and periods of very high aerosol concentrations. This study also includes a simplified aerosol/CCN closure analysis. Aerosol size distributions were measured simultaneously with the CCN observations, and these data are used to predict a CCN concentration using Köhler theory. For the purpose of this analysis, an idealized composition of pure ammonium sulfate was assumed. The analysis indicates that in this case, there was good general agreement between the predicted and observed CCN concentrations: at S = 0.2\%, Npredicted/Nobserved = 1.047 (R2 = 0.911); at S = 0.85\%, Npredicted/Nobserved = 1.201 (R2 = 0.835). The impacts of the compositional assumption and of including in‐cloud data in the analysis are addressed. The effect of removing the data from the 28 July flight is also examined; doing so improves the result of the closure analysis at S = 0.85\%. When omitting that atypical flight, Npredicted/Nobserved = 1.085 (R2 = 0.770) at S = 0.85\%.},

CAM Version 3 (CAM3) is an atmospheric general circulation model that includes the Community Land Model (CLM3), an optional slab ocean model, and a thermodynamic sea ice model. The dynamics and physics in CAM3 have been changed substantially compared to implementations in previous versions. CAM3 includes options for Eulerian spectral, semi-Lagrangian, and finite-volume formulations of the dynamical equations. It supports coupled simulations using either finite-volume or Eulerian dynamics through an explicit set of adjustable parameters governing the model time step, cloud parameterizations, and condensation processes. The model includes major modifications to the parameterizations of moist processes, radiation processes, and aerosols. These changes have improved several aspects of the simulated climate, including more realistic tropical tropopause temperatures, boreal winter land surface temperatures, surface insolation, and clear-sky surface radiation in polar regions. The variation of cloud radiative forcing during ENSO events exhibits much better agreement with satellite observations. Despite these improvements, several systematic biases reduce the fidelity of the simulations. These biases include underestimation of tropical variability, errors in tropical oceanic surface fluxes, underestimation of implied ocean heat transport in the Southern Hemisphere, excessive surface stress in the storm tracks, and offsets in the 500-mb height field and the Aleutian low.},

Presently, marine low clouds are poorly represented in global climate models, and the response of marine low clouds to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols remains the major source of uncertainty in climate simulations. The eastern North Atlantic (ENA) is a region of persistent but diverse subtropical marine boundary layer clouds, whose albedo and precipitation are highly susceptible to perturbations in aerosol properties. In addition, the ENA is periodically impacted by continental aerosols, making it an excellent location to study the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) budget in a remote marine region periodically perturbed by anthropogenic emissions, and to investigate the impacts of long-range transport of aerosols on remote marine clouds. The Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) campaign was motivated by the need of comprehensive in situ measurements for improving the understanding of marine boundary layer CCN budget, cloud and drizzle microphysics, and the impact of aerosol on marine low cloud and precipitation. The airborne deployments took place from 21 June to 20 July 2017 and from 15 January to 18 February 2018 in the Azores. The flights were designed to maximize the synergy between in situ airborne measurements and ongoing long-term observations at a ground site. Here we present measurements, observation strategy, meteorological conditions during the campaign, and preliminary findings. Finally, we discuss future analyses and modeling studies that improve the understanding and representation of marine boundary layer aerosols, clouds, precipitation, and the interactions among them.},

A southward shift of these rain belts has been observed throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, with profound societal consequences. Although such large-scale shifts in rainfall have been linked to interhemispheric temperature gradients from anthropogenic aerosols, a complete understanding of this mechanism has been hindered by the lack of explicit information on aerosol radiative effects. Here we quantify the relative contributions of radiative forcing from anthropogenic aerosols to the interhemispheric asymmetry in temperature and precipitation change for climate change simulations. We show that in model simulations the vast majority of the precipitation shift does not result from aerosols directly through their absorption and scattering of radiation, but rather indirectly through their modification of cloud radiative properties. Models with larger cloud responses to aerosol forcing are found to better reproduce the observed interhemispheric temperature changes and tropical rain belt shifts over the twentieth century, suggesting that aerosol–cloud interactions will play a key role in determining future interhemispheric shifts in climate.},

Hitherto, the inability to do so has been a major cause of high uncertainty regarding anthropogenic aerosol/cloud-mediated radiative forcing. This can be addressed by the emerging capability of estimating CCN and Wb of boundary layer convective clouds from an operational polar orbiting weather satellite. Our methodology uses such clouds as an effective analog for CCN chambers. The cloud base supersaturation (S) is determined by Wb and the satellite-retrieved cloud base drop concentrations (Ndb), which is the same as CCN(S). Validation against ground-based CCN instruments at Oklahoma, at Manaus, and onboard a ship in the northeast Pacific showed a retrieval accuracy of ±25\% to ±30\% for individual satellite overpasses. The methodology is presently limited to boundary layer not raining convective clouds of at least 1 km depth that are not obscured by upper layer clouds, including semitransparent cirrus. The limitation for small solar backscattering angles of {\textless}25° restricts the satellite coverage to ∼25\% of the world area in a single day.},

	abstract = {Can the current successes of global machine learning‐based weather simulators be generalized beyond 2‐week forecasts to stable and accurate multiyear runs? The recently developed AI2 Climate Emulator (ACE) suggests this is feasible, based upon 10‐year simulations with a network trained on output from a physics‐based global atmosphere model using a grid spacing of approximately 110 km and forced by a repeating annual cycle of sea‐surface temperature. Here we show that ACE, without modification, can be trained to emulate another major atmospheric model, EAMv2, run at a comparable grid spacing for at least 10 years with similarly small climate biases—a prerequisite to wider applicability. With an analysis that combines multiple temporal, spatial, and frequency domain perspectives, we show that ACE faithfully represents the spatiotemporal structure of EAMv2 precipitation and related variables. Finally, we show that a pretrained ACE network is able to adapt to a new global climate model simulation data set with 10× \$\{{\textbackslash}times\} \$ fewer training steps than when starting from random initialization, all while still maintaining low levels of climate bias. Further analysis of these fine‐tuning experiments reveal ACE's intriguing ability to interpolate between distinct global climate models. Traditional methods to predict the weather use mathematical models of the Earth's atmosphere that are costly to run. However, “data‐driven” weather prediction methods, which learn to predict future weather directly from data on past weather, have come to match or even beat traditional methods and do so with much less running cost. In contrast to weather prediction where the goal is to predict the weather in the near future, in climate modeling the goal is to study the Earth's long‐term weather trends under different possible future scenarios for many years into the future. Until the introduction of the AI2 Climate Emulator (ACE), a recent data‐driven method for climate modeling, no data‐driven method could match traditional climate models. In this work we test ACE's climate modeling skills and find that it is able to faithfully mimic a traditional model of the climate when looking at patterns of rainfall around the globe and in the tropics. After learning to mimic one climate model, ACE is able to adapt to a new climate model in much less time. These results show that ACE has the potential to simulate the Earth's climate under many more scenarios and with much lower cost than ever before.

Ships are large, isolated sources of aerosol creating linear cloud formations known as shiptracks. These are an ideal opportunity to identify and measure aerosol‐cloud interactions. This work uses over 17,000 shiptracks during the implementation of fuel sulfur content regulations to demonstrate the central role of sulfate aerosol in ship exhaust for modifying clouds. By connecting individual shiptracks to transponder data, it is shown that almost half of shiptracks are likely undetected, masking a significant contribution to the climate impact of shipping. A pathway to retrieving ship sulfate emissions is demonstrated, showing how cloud observations could be used to monitor air pollution. Ships often burn heavy fuel oil, typically creating large amounts of particulate pollution, which is known to modify cloud properties. This creates linear cloud formations, known as shiptracks. In this work, we investigate how the occurrence and properties of shiptracks are related to the particulate emissions from individual ships. We show that the introduction of regulation on ship fuel has already produced a dramatic effect on cloud properties, with shiptracks almost disappearing completely in regions where fuel is regulated. With this new information about the particulates produced by specific ships, we also show that many shiptracks are likely undetected by current identification methods. This study also provides a pathway toward measuring ship emissions using satellite data.

	abstract = {Estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity differ depending on the method of calculation. This study shows estimates based on the historical energy budget are low as climate feedbacks vary with time and the bias depends on the sensitivity of the system. Global energy budget constraints1,2,3 suggest an equilibrium climate sensitivity around 2 °C, which is lower than estimates from palaeoclimate reconstructions4, process-based observational analyses5,6,7, and global climate model simulations8,9. A key assumption is that the climate sensitivity inferred today also applies to the distant future. Yet, global climate models robustly show that feedbacks vary over time, with a strong tendency for climate sensitivity to increase as equilibrium is approached9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Here I consider the implications of inconstant climate feedbacks for energy budget constraints on climate sensitivity. I find that the long-term value of climate sensitivity is, on average, 26\% above that inferred during transient warming within global climate models, with a larger discrepancy when climate sensitivity is high. Moreover, model values of climate sensitivity inferred during transient warming are found to be consistent with energy budget observations1,2,3, indicating that the models are not overly sensitive. Using model-based estimates of how climate feedbacks will change in the future, in conjunction with recent energy budget constraints1,19, produces a current best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.9 °C (1.7–7.1 °C, 90\% confidence). These findings suggest that climate sensitivity estimated from global energy budget constraints is in agreement with values derived from other methods and simulated by global climate models.},

	abstract = {The multi-variate optimal fingerprint method for the detection of an externally forced climate change signal in the presence of natural internal variability is extended to the attribution problem. To determine whether a climate change signal which has been detected in observed climate data can be attributed to a particular climate forcing mechanism, or combination of mechanisms, the predicted space–time dependent climate change signal patterns for the candidate climate forcings must be specified. In addition to the signal patterns, the method requires input information on the space–time dependent covariance matrices of the natural climate variability and of the errors of the predicted signal patterns. The detection and attribution problem is treated as a sequence of individual consistency tests applied to all candidate forcing mechanisms, as well as to the null hypothesis that no climate change has taken place, within the phase space spanned by the predicted climate change patterns. As output the method yields a significance level for the detection of a climate change signal in the observed data and individual confidence levels for the consistency of the retrieved climate change signal with each of the forcing mechanisms. A statistically significant climate change signal is regarded as consistent with a given forcing mechanism if the statistical confidence level exceeds a given critical value, but is attributed to that forcing only if all other candidate climate change mechanisms (from a finite set of proposed mechanisms) are rejected at that confidence level. Although all relations can be readily expressed in standard matrix notation, the analysis is carried out using tensor notation, with a metric given by the natural-variability covariance matrix. This simplifies the derivations and clarifies the invariant relation between the covariant signal patterns and their contravariant fingerprint counterparts. The signal patterns define the reduced vector space in which the climate trajectories are analyzed, while the fingerprints are needed to project the climate trajectories onto this reduced space.},

	abstract = {Oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in cloud water by reaction with ozone is an important sulfate aerosol formation mechanism and strongly dependent on the acidity of cloud water. Decadal reductions in Northern Hemisphere sulfur emissions have contributed to higher cloud water pH, thereby altering sulfate formation rates. Here we use a global composition‐climate model to show that changes in cloud water pH over the 1970–2009 period strongly affects the aerosol particle size distribution, cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, and the magnitude of aerosol radiative forcing. The simulated all‐sky aerosol radiative forcing (1970–2009) over the North Atlantic is +1.2 W m−2 if pH remains constant at 5.0, as in many climate models. However, the forcing increases to +5.2 W m−2 if pH is assumed to increase by 1.0 unit over this period. Global composition climate models need to account for variations in cloud water pH to improve the representation of sulfate aerosol formation and aerosol radiative effects. Particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) can be harmful to human health at the surface and also affect the Earth's climate. Sulfate is a major component of atmospheric aerosols. It is formed from chemical reactions involving sulfur dioxide, which has large man‐made sources in the energy and industrial sectors. This study investigates the sensitivity of sulfate aerosol formation in clouds to the assumed acidity of the cloud water. Large changes in man‐made emissions over the Northern Hemisphere in the last 30 years have altered the acidity of cloud water. Here we used climate model simulations that include a representation of aerosols and chemistry to investigate the effect of changes in cloud water acidity on sulfate aerosol formation between 1970 and 2009. Our analysis shows that changes in the acidity of cloud water has a strong effect on the properties of aerosols and how they interact with the Earth's radiative balance. The impact is shown to be particularly important for cloudy regions like the North Atlantic that are sensitive to changes in aerosols. The results highlight that the impact of changes in cloud water acidity on aerosols should be included within climate models to improve our representation of aerosols and their interaction with climate. Increases in assumed cloud water pH can improve simulation of sulfate aerosols Aerosol radiative forcing over the last 40 years is sensitive to the value of cloud water pH Global composition climate models assuming a fixed value of cloud water pH do not fully account for recent aerosol radiative forcing},

To fill this gap, we build a large dataset, ClimART, with more than {\textbackslash}emph\{10 million samples from present, pre-industrial, and future climate conditions\}, based on the Canadian Earth System Model. ClimART poses several methodological challenges for the ML community, such as multiple out-of-distribution test sets, underlying domain physics, and a trade-off between accuracy and inference speed.

We use calibrated satellite radiation measurements and five independent surface radiometers to quantify the aerosol forcing simultaneously at the Earth's surface and the top of the atmosphere over the tropical northern Indian Ocean. In winter, this region is covered by anthropogenic aerosols of sulphate, nitrate, organics, soot and fly ash from the south Asian continent7,8. Accordingly, mean clear-sky solar radiative heating for the winters of 1998 and 1999 decreased at the ocean surface by 12 to 30 W m-2, but only by 4 to 10 W m-2 at the top of the atmosphere. This threefold difference (due largely to solar absorption by soot) and the large magnitude of the observed surface forcing both imply that tropical aerosols might slow down the hydrological cycle.},

The simulated speciated aerosol (organic aerosol (OA), black carbon, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) mass concentrations are evaluated against airborne observations made during all four seasons of the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) deployments over the remote Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Such measurements over pristine environments offer fresh insights into the spatial (Northern [NH] and Southern Hemispheres [SH], Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans) and temporal (all seasons) variability in aerosol composition and lifetime, away from continental sources. The model captures the dominance of fine OA and sulfate aerosol mass concentrations in all seasons. There is a high bias across all species in the ATom‐2 (NH winter) simulations; implementing recent updates to the wet scavenging parameterization improves our simulations, eliminating the large ATom‐2 (NH winter) bias, improving the ATom‐1 (NH summer) and ATom‐3 (NH fall) simulations, but producing a model underestimate in aerosol mass concentrations for the ATom‐4 (NH spring) simulations. Following the wet scavenging updates, simulated global annual mean aerosol lifetimes vary from 1.9 to 4.0 days, depending on species. Aerosol lifetimes in each hemisphere vary by season, and are longest for carbonaceous aerosol during the southern hemispheric fire season. The updated wet scavenging parameterization brings simulated concentrations closer to observations and reduces global aerosol lifetime for all species, indicating the sensitivity of global aerosol lifetime and burden to wet removal processes. Aerosols are a key constituent of the atmosphere. Their lifetime in the atmosphere controls their global distribution and the resulting air quality and climate impacts. We use a global model (GEOS‐Chem) to simulate their mass concentrations. To evaluate the model, we compare simulations against airborne measurements over the remote Pacific and Atlantic oceans made in all four seasons during the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom). The model generally reproduces organic and sulfate aerosols well, yet it over‐estimates all species in the Northern Hemispheric (NH) winter season. An updated wet deposition method, which provides more effective aerosol removal, reduced the overestimation in this season, improved the simulation in NH summer and fall as well, but underestimated the concentrations in NH spring. With the model update, aerosol lifetimes vary from 1.9 to 4.0 days and by species and seasons, with organic aerosols and black carbon having the longest lifetime during the Southern Hemispheric fire season. The updated wet deposition scheme reduces these lifetimes significantly, demonstrating the sensitivity of aerosol lifetime and concentration to the wet removal process.

Here, a moist energy balance model is used to evaluate several SRM proposals, providing fundamental insight into how the insolation reduction profile affects the climate response. The optimal SRM profile is found to depend on the intensity of the intervention, as the most effective profile for moderate SRM focuses the reduction at high latitudes, whereas the most effective profile for strong SRM is tropically amplified. The effectiveness of SRM is also shown to depend on when it is applied, an important factor to consider when designing SRM proposals. Using an energy balance model allows us to provide physical explanations for these results while also suggesting future avenues of research with comprehensive climate models.

We use observations of forest fraction to constrain carbon cycle and land surface input parameters of the global climate model FAMOUS, in the presence of an uncertain structural error. Using an ensemble of climate model runs to build a computationally cheap statistical proxy (emulator) of the climate model, we use history matching to rule out input parameter settings where the corresponding climate model output is judged sufficiently different from observations, even allowing for uncertainty. Regions of parameter space where FAMOUS best simulates the Amazon forest fraction are incompatible with the regions where FAMOUS best simulates other forests, indicating a structural error in the model. We use the emulator to simulate the forest fraction at the best set of parameters implied by matching the model to the Amazon, Central African, South East Asian, and North American forests in turn. We can find parameters that lead to a realistic forest fraction in the Amazon, but that using the Amazon alone to tune the simulator would result in a significant overestimate of forest fraction in the other forests. Conversely, using the other forests to tune the simulator leads to a larger underestimate of the Amazon forest fraction. We use sensitivity analysis to find the parameters which have the most impact on simulator output and perform a history-matching exercise using credible estimates for simulator discrepancy and observational uncertainty terms. We are unable to constrain the parameters individually, but we rule out just under half of joint parameter space as being incompatible with forest observations.

We show that, in general, the climate response, specifically the global mean temperature change, is sensitive to the altitude, latitude, and nature of the forcing; that is, the response to a given forcing can vary by 50\% or more depending upon characteristics of the forcing other than its magnitude measured in watts per square meter. The consistency of the response among different forcings is higher, within 20\% or better, for most of the globally distributed forcings suspected of influencing global mean temperature in the past century, but exceptions occur for certain changes of ozone or absorbing aerosols, for which the climate response is less well behaved. In all cases the physical basis for the variations of the response can be understood. The principal mechanisms involve alterations of lapse rate and decrease (increase) of large‐scale cloud cover in layers that are preferentially heated (cooled). Although the magnitude of these effects must be model‐dependent, the existence and sense of the mechanisms appear to be reasonable. Overall, we reaffirm the value of the radiative forcing concept for predicting climate response and for comparative studies of different forcings; indeed, the present results can help improve the accuracy of such analyses and define error estimates. Our results also emphasize the need for measurements having the specificity and precision needed to define poorly known forcings such as absorbing aerosols and ozone change. Available data on aerosol single scatter albedo imply that anthropogenic aerosols cause less cooling than has commonly been assumed. However, negative forcing due to the net ozone change since 1979 appears to have counterbalanced 30–50\% of the positive forcing due to the increase of well‐mixed greenhouse gases in the same period. As the net ozone change includes halogen‐driven ozone depletion with negative radiative forcing and a tropospheric ozone increase with positive radiative forcing, it is possible that the halogen‐driven ozone depletion has counterbalanced more than half of the radiative forcing due to well‐mixed greenhouse gases since 1979.},

However, large‐scale processes need to be prescribed or represented parameterically in the limited‐area LES domains. It is important that the representation of large‐scale processes satisfies constraints such as a closed energy balance in a manner that is realizable under climate change. For example, LES with fixed sea surface temperatures usually do not close the surface energy balance, potentially leading to spurious surface fluxes and cloud responses to climate change. Here a framework of forcing LES of subtropical MBL clouds is presented that enforces a closed surface energy balance by coupling atmospheric LES to an ocean mixed layer with a sea surface temperature (SST) that depends on radiative fluxes and sensible and latent heat fluxes at the surface. A variety of subtropical MBL cloud regimes (stratocumulus, cumulus, and stratocumulus over cumulus) are simulated successfully within this framework. However, unlike in conventional frameworks with fixed SST, feedbacks between cloud cover and SST arise, which can lead to sudden transitions between cloud regimes (e.g., stratocumulus to cumulus) as forcing parameters are varied. The simulations validate this framework for studies of MBL clouds and establish its usefulness for studies of how the clouds respond to climate change. A framework is presented for forcing LES of low clouds with a closed surface energy budget Subtropical low clouds are successfully simulated, like in conventional frameworks with fixed SST Feedbacks between cloud cover and SST can lead to transitions between different cloud regimes},

Comparison of monthly averaged aerosol number concentrations against 60 measurement sites reveals that the model with explicit nucleation and SOA scheme performs well in terms of correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.41 and a bias of −6\%.

The first two campaigns, PEM‐West A and B were conducted over the northwestern regions of the Pacific and focused on the impact of emissions from the Asian continent. The broad objectives of PEM‐Tropics included improving our understanding of the oxidizing power of the tropical atmosphere as well as investigating oceanic sulfur compounds and their conversion to aerosols. Phase A of the PEM‐Tropics program, conducted between August‐September 1996, involved the NASA DC‐8 and P‐3B aircraft. Phase B of this program is scheduled for March/April 1999. During PEM‐Tropics A, the flight tracks of the two aircraft extended zonally across the entire Pacific Basin and meridionally from Hawaii to south of New Zealand. Both aircraft were instrumented for airborne measurements of trace gases and aerosols and meteorological parameters. The DC‐8, given its long‐range and high‐altitude capabilities coupled with the lidar instrument in its payload, focused on transport issues and ozone photochemistry, while the P‐3B, with its sulfur‐oriented instrument payload and more limited range, focused on detailed sulfur process studies. Among its accomplishments, the PEM‐Tropics A field campaign has provided a unique set of atmospheric measurements in a heretofore data sparse region; demonstrated the capability of several new or improved instruments for measuring OH, H2SO4, NO, NO2, and actinic fluxes; and conducted experiments which tested our understanding of HOx and NOx photochemistry, as well as sulfur oxidation and aerosol formation processes. In addition, PEM‐Tropics A documented for the first time the considerable and widespread influence of biomass burning pollution over the South Pacific, and identified the South Pacific Convergence Zone as a major barrier for atmospheric transport in the southern hemisphere.},

	abstract = {Climate models are essential to understand and project climate change, yet long-standing biases and uncertainties in their projections remain. This is largely associated with the representation of subgrid-scale processes, particularly clouds and convection. Deep learning can learn these subgrid-scale processes from computationally expensive storm-resolving models while retaining many features at a fraction of computational cost. Yet, climate simulations with embedded neural network parameterizations are still challenging and highly depend on the deep learning solution. This is likely associated with spurious non-physical correlations learned by the neural networks due to the complexity of the physical dynamical system. Here, we show that the combination of causality with deep learning helps removing spurious correlations and optimizing the neural network algorithm. To resolve this, we apply a causal discovery method to unveil key physical drivers in the set of input predictors of atmospheric subgrid-scale processes of a superparameterized climate model in which deep convection is explicitly resolved. The resulting causally-informed neural networks are coupled to the climate model, hence, replacing the superparameterization and radiation scheme. We show that the climate simulations with causally-informed neural network parameterizations retain many convection-related properties of the original high-resolution climate model and clearly outperform the non-causal approach, while retaining similar generalization capabilities to unseen climates. The combination of causal discovery and deep learning is a new and promising approach that leads to stable and more accurate climate simulations and paves the way towards more physically-based causal deep learning approaches also in other scientific disciplines.},

	abstract = {We introduce a machine-learning (ML)-based weather simulator--called "GraphCast"--which outperforms the most accurate deterministic operational medium-range weather forecasting system in the world, as well as all previous ML baselines. GraphCast is an autoregressive model, based on graph neural networks and a novel high-resolution multi-scale mesh representation, which we trained on historical weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ERA5 reanalysis archive. It can make 10-day forecasts, at 6-hour time intervals, of five surface variables and six atmospheric variables, each at 37 vertical pressure levels, on a 0.25-degree latitude-longitude grid, which corresponds to roughly 25 x 25 kilometer resolution at the equator. Our results show GraphCast is more accurate than ECMWF's deterministic operational forecasting system, HRES, on 90.0\% of the 2760 variable and lead time combinations we evaluated. GraphCast also outperforms the most accurate previous ML-based weather forecasting model on 99.2\% of the 252 targets it reported. GraphCast can generate a 10-day forecast (35 gigabytes of data) in under 60 seconds on Cloud TPU v4 hardware. Unlike traditional forecasting methods, ML-based forecasting scales well with data: by training on bigger, higher quality, and more recent data, the skill of the forecasts can improve. Together these results represent a key step forward in complementing and improving weather modeling with ML, open new opportunities for fast, accurate forecasting, and help realize the promise of ML-based simulation in the physical sciences.},

Patterns of mesoscale organisation observed from space were subjectively defined and learned by 12 trained scientists. The ability of individuals to communicate, learn and replicate the classification was evaluated. Nine‐hundred satellite images spanning the area from 48°W to 58°W, 10°N to 20°N for the boreal winter months (December–February) over 10 years (2007/2008 to 2016/2017) were classified. Each scene was independently labelled by six scientists as being dominated by one of six patterns (one of which was “no‐pattern”). Four patterns of mesoscale organisation could be labelled in a reproducible manner, and were labelled Sugar, Gravel, Fish and Flowers. Sugar consists of small, low clouds of low reflectivity, Gravel clouds form along apparent gust fronts, Fish are skeletal networks (often fishbone‐like) of clouds, while Flowers are circular clumped features defined more by their stratiform cloud elements. Both Fish and Flowers are surrounded by large areas of clear air. These four named patterns were identified 40\% of the time, with the most common pattern being Gravel. Sugar was identified the least and suggests that unorganised and very shallow convection is unlikely to dominate large areas of the downstream trade winds. Some of the patterns show signs of seasonal and interannual variability, and some degree of scale selectivity. Comparison of typical patterns with radar imagery suggests that even this subjective and qualitative visual inspection of imagery appears to capture several important physical differences between shallow cloud regimes, such as precipitation and radiative effects. Sugar: MODIS‐Aqua scenes from Worldview. The images cover the area from 60°W to 48°W and 10°N to 20°N. For these images the scenes have been extended to the west to include Barbados, coloured in artificial green, on the far left. For a sense of scale, Barbados fits in a rectangle of east–west dimension of 25 km and north–south dimension of 30 km. Depending on the quality of the reproduction, some features distinguishing these from other patterns may be difficult to discern from printed (rather than electronic) renditions of this article.

The cumuliform cloud data were collected during NASA's Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers–Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE, Key West, Florida, July 2002), while the stratiform cloud data were gathered during Coastal Stratocumulus Imposed Perturbation Experiment (CSTRIPE, Monterey, California, July 2003). In situ data sets of aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and updraft velocities are used as input for the NS parameterization, and the evaluation is carried out by comparing predicted cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) with observations. This is the first known study in which a prognostic cloud droplet activation parameterization has been evaluated against a wide range of observations. On average, predicted droplet concentration in adiabatic regions is within ∼20\% of observations at the base of cumuliform clouds and ∼30\% of observations at different altitudes throughout the stratiform clouds, all within experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, CDNC is well parameterized using either a single mean updraft velocity or by weighting droplet nucleation rates with a Gaussian probability density function of w. This study suggests that for nonprecipitating warm clouds of variable microphysics, aerosol composition, and size distribution the modified NS parameterization can accurately predict cloud droplet activation and can be successfully implemented for describing the aerosol activation process in global climate models.},

As with the skill scores used to measure the accuracy of short-term weather forecasts, these metrics are low-order statistical measures of agreement with relevant, well-observed physical quantities. The metrics encompass five statistical summaries computed for five physical quantities (longwave, shortwave, and net cloud radiative effect, projected cloud fraction, and surface precipitation rate) over the global climatological annual cycle. Agreement is measured against two independent observational data sets. The metrics are computed for the models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3, which formed the basis for the Fourth Assessment of the IPCC. Model skill does not depend strongly on the data set used for verification, indicating that observational uncertainty does not limit the ability to assess model simulations of these fields. No individual model excels in all scores though the “IPCC mean model,” constructed by averaging the fields produced by all the CMIP models, performs particularly well across the board. This skill is due primarily to the individual model errors being distributed on both sides of the observations, and to a lesser degree to the models having greater skill at simulating large-scale features than those near the grid scale. No measure of model skill considered here is a good predictor of the strength of cloud feedbacks under climate change. The model climatologies, observational data sets, and metric scores are available on-line.},

The parameterization is based on analysis of the rate equations for the parcel supersaturation and aerosol activation process. The analysis leads to the identification of only four dimensionless parameters on which the fraction of activation strongly depends. Using results of detailed numerical simulations by a size‐resolving Lagrangian parcel model, errors due to simplifying assumptions used in the analysis were largely eliminated by employing adjustment coefficients. For a wide range of governing parameters (e.g., particle radius, standard deviation, updraft velocity, etc.), differences between the parametric equations and the numerical model results are less than 10\% for most conditions and less than 25\% for some extreme but realistic conditions. This new parameterization is significantly more accurate and successful in representing the fraction of activation in terms of governing parameters than any known parameterization.},

The nonvolatile residual particles were then analyzed by various instruments. Physical and chemical properties of the cloud droplets and their residual nuclei were compared with properties of the below‐cloud aerosol to evaluate which aerosol particles act as cloud nuclei in different environments, and their effects on cloud microphysics. Four cases, ranging from clean Southern Hemispheric clouds to heavily polluted clouds near India, were analyzed. For the cleaner clouds, droplet concentrations were a much higher fraction of the available particle concentrations than for polluted clouds, but entrainment apparently acted to reduce droplet number concentrations in both regimes. For clean clouds the median critical supersaturation and size of the ambient particles and droplet residual particles were similar. In polluted clouds there were stronger differences between ambient and droplet residual distributions, and particles with lower critical supersaturations were favored as nuclei. Simple model calculations were used to show that polluted clouds are expected to achieve lower water supersaturations than clean clouds; thus only particles with relatively low critical supersaturations are likely to affect clouds in polluted regions. Soluble fractions for the ambient aerosol inferred from the size and cloud condensation nuclei measurements were in general agreement with another study in the region. Droplet residual particles did not necessarily have higher soluble fractions than the ambient aerosol, but did tend to have higher total amounts of soluble material per particle, particularly in the polluted cases.},

	abstract = {This work describes the formulation and climatology of an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, based on a spectral primitive-equation dynamical core and a set of simplified physical parametrization schemes. The parametrization package has been specially designed to work in models with just a few vertical levels, and is based on the same physical principles adopted in the schemes of state-of-the art GCMs. The parametrized processes include large-scale condensation, convection, clouds, short-wave and long-wave radiation, surface fluxes and vertical diffusion. In the current configuration, the model (nicknamed SPEEDY, from Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics") has five vertical levels and a spectral truncation at total wave number 30 (T30L5). The top vertical level (crudely) represents the stratosphere, the bottom one the planetary boundary layer. Computationally, SPEEDY requires (at least) one order of magnitude less CPU time than a state-of-the-art GCM at the same horizontal resolution, and is therefore suitable for studies of inter-decadal or inter-centennial variability. Statistics of the model mean state and variability are computed from an ensemble of 41-year simulations forced by observed sea-surface temperatures in the period 1952–1992. The model mean state is closer to the observed climatology during the (boreal) winter than during summer. In winter (i.e. December to February, DJF), the model underestimates the amplitude of the Northern Hemisphere stationary wave pattern, particularly in the European-Atlantic sector. Some aspects of the systematic error of SPEEDY are in fact typical of many GCMs, although the error amplitude is stronger than in state-of-the-art models. On the other hand, the global distribution of precipitation in DJF is quite realistic, and compares well with that of more complex GCMs. In summer (June to August), a strong negative bias in the mid-tropospheric temperature generates a Northern Hemisphere circulation with some springtime characteristics. In particular, the position of the Tropical Convergence Zone in the Indian Ocean remains too far south, leading to a deficient simulation of the monsoon circulation over South Asia. The simulated variability during the northern winter is reasonably realistic as far as the spatial distribution is concerned, although some underestimation in the intensity can be found, particularly in the low-frequency range and in the Atlantic sector. The atmospheric response to ENSO events is also weaker than observed, although the spatial patterns of the rainfall and geopotential response in the Pacific sector are in phase with their observed counterparts. In the Atlantic/Eurasian region, the spatial patterns associated with the interdecadal trends in the simulated and observed large-scale circulation show a clear positive correlation, consistent with the hypothesis of a positive ocean–atmosphere feedback on decadal time scales.},

	abstract = {Historical changes of global precipitation in the 20th century simulated by a climate model are investigated. The results simulated with alternate configurations of cloud microphysics are analyzed in the context of energy balance controls on global precipitation, where the latent heat changes associated with the precipitation change is nearly balanced with changes to atmospheric radiative cooling. The atmospheric radiative cooling is dominated by its clear-sky component, which is found to correlate with changes to both column water vapor and aerosol optical depth (AOD). The water vapor-dependent component of the clear-sky radiative cooling is then found to scale with global temperature change through the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship. This component results in a tendency of global precipitation increase with increasing temperature at a rate of approximately 2\%K−1. Another component of the clear-sky radiative cooling, which is well correlated with changes to AOD, is also found to vary in magnitude among different scenarios with alternate configurations of cloud microphysics that controls the precipitation efficiency, a major factor influencing the aerosol scavenging process that can lead to different aerosol loadings. These results propose how different characteristics of cloud microphysics can cause different aerosol loadings that in turn perturb global energy balance to significantly change global precipitation. This implies a possible coupling of aerosol–cloud interaction with aerosol–radiation interaction in the context of global energy balance.},

	abstract = {Understanding the physical drivers of seasonal hydroclimatic variability and improving predictive skill remains a challenge with important socioeconomic and environmental implications for many regions around the world. Physics-based deterministic models show limited ability to predict precipitation as the lead time increases, due to imperfect representation of physical processes and incomplete knowledge of initial conditions. Similarly, statistical methods drawing upon established climate teleconnections have low prediction skill due to the complex nature of the climate system. Recently, promising data-driven approaches have been proposed, but they often suffer from overparameterization and overfitting due to the short observational record, and they often do not account for spatiotemporal dependencies among covariates (i.e., predictors such as sea surface temperatures). This study addresses these challenges via a predictive model based on a graph-guided regularizer that simultaneously promotes similarity of predictive weights for highly correlated covariates and enforces sparsity in the covariate domain. This approach both decreases the effective dimensionality of the problem and identifies the most predictive features without specifying them a priori. We use large ensemble simulations from a climate model to construct this regularizer, reducing the structural uncertainty in the estimation. We apply the learned model to predict winter precipitation in the southwestern United States using sea surface temperatures over the entire Pacific basin, and demonstrate its superiority compared to other regularization approaches and statistical models informed by known teleconnections. Our results highlight the potential to combine optimally the space-time structure of predictor variables learned from climate models with new graph-based regularizers to improve seasonal prediction.},

A variation on superparameterization (SP) called “ultraparameterization” (UP) is developed, in which the grid spacing of the cloud-resolving models (CRMs) is fine enough (250 × 20 m) to explicitly capture the BL turbulence, associated clouds, and entrainment in a global climate model capable of multiyear simulations. UP is implemented within the Community Atmosphere Model using 2° resolution (∼14,000 embedded CRMs) with one-moment microphysics. By using a small domain and mean-state acceleration, UP is computationally feasible today and promising for exascale computers. Short-duration global UP hindcasts are compared with SP and satellite observations of top-of-atmosphere radiation and cloud vertical structure. The most encouraging improvement is a deeper BL and more realistic vertical structure of subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) clouds, due to stronger vertical eddy motions that promote entrainment. Results from 90 day integrations show climatological errors that are competitive with SP, with a significant improvement in the diurnal cycle of offshore Sc liquid water. Ongoing concerns with the current UP implementation include a dim bias for near-coastal Sc that also occurs less prominently in SP and a bright bias over tropical continental deep convection zones. Nevertheless, UP makes global eddy-permitting simulation a feasible and interesting alternative to conventionally parameterized GCMs or SP-GCMs with turbulence parameterizations for studying BL cloud-climate and cloud-aerosol feedback.},

A new technique for testing the field significance of data-mined correlations which avoids these problems is presented.

	abstract = {Tropical deep convection can aggregate into large clusters, which can have impacts on the local humidity and precipitation. Sea surface temperature (SST) gradients have been shown to organize convection, yet there has been little work done to investigate the impact of diabatic heating perturbations in the atmosphere on the aggregation of convection. Here we investigate how anomalous diabatic heating of the atmospheric column, through an idealized aerosol plume, affects the existence and mechanisms of convective aggregation in non‐rotating, global radiative‐convective equilibrium simulations. We show that the aerosol forcing has the ability to increase the degree of aggregation, especially at lower SSTs. Detailed investigation shows that the diabatic heating source incites a thermally driven circulation, forced by the shortwave perturbation. The increase in aggregation is caused in part by this circulation, and in part by the longwave heating anomalies occurring due to the surface convergence of moisture and convection. At higher SSTs, longwave feedbacks are crucial for the aggregation of convection, even with the shortwave heating perturbation. At lower SSTs, convection is able to aggregate with the shortwave perturbation in the absence of longwave feedbacks. These perturbations provide a link to studying the effects of absorbing aerosol plumes on convection, for example during the Indian monsoon season. We argue that, as there is aggregation for plumes with realistic aerosol absorption optical depths, this could be an analogue for real‐world organization in regions with high pollution. Tropical clouds grouping together into large clusters in idealized climate models is an interesting topic of research. When this happens, the average temperature increases with more rain where the clouds are and less rain away from them. This paper looks at how we can force clouds to cluster together. We use plumes of aerosols to cause heating perturbations. We show that this causes a large‐scale circulation to develop, with warm air rising near to the plume and cold air sinking further away from it. This helps clouds to cluster together, through changes in the absorption and reflection of longwave and shortwave radiation. We highlight that real‐world pollution plumes or dust events may have similar effects on the clustering of clouds near to them.

	abstract = {The combustion of fossil fuels produces emissions of the long-lived greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and of short-lived pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, that contribute to the formation of atmospheric aerosols1. Atmospheric aerosols can cool the climate, masking some of the warming effect that results from the emission of greenhouse gases1. However, aerosol particulates are highly toxic when inhaled, leading to millions of premature deaths per year2,3. The phasing out of unabated fossil-fuel combustion will therefore provide health benefits, but will also reduce the extent to which the warming induced by greenhouse gases is masked by aerosols. Because aerosol levels respond much more rapidly to changes in emissions relative to carbon dioxide, large near-term increases in the magnitude and rate of climate warming are predicted in many idealized studies that typically assume an instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic or fossil-fuel-related emissions1,4–9. Here we show that more realistic modelling scenarios do not produce a substantial near-term increase in either the magnitude or the rate of warming, and in fact can lead to a decrease in warming rates within two decades of the start of the fossil-fuel phase-out. Accounting for the time required to transform power generation, industry and transportation leads to gradually increasing and largely offsetting climate impacts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, with the rate of warming further slowed by reductions in fossil-methane emissions. Our results indicate that even the most aggressive plausible transition to a clean-energy society provides benefits for climate change mitigation and air quality at essentially all decadal to centennial timescales. Scenarios that model a realistic phase-out of fossil fuels find no substantial near-term increase in the rate of warming, and suggest benefits for climate change mitigation and air quality at essentially all timescales.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), dimethylsulfide (DMS), and DMS flux are reported for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Great Barrier Reef Lagoon (GBRL), and Coral Sea. Generally higher concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate and DMS occurred in coral reef waters, compared with GBRL concentrations. DMS flux from GBR coral reefs in summer ranged from nondetectable to 153 μmol m−2 d−1 (mean 6.4), while winter fluxes ranged from 0.02 to 15 μmol m−2 d−1 (mean 2.4). No significant seasonal difference in DMS flux occurred for the GBRL. High DMSw concentrations and DMS fluxes periodically occur at coral reefs during very low tides and elevated sea surface temperatures (SSTs). For the GBRL and GBR coral reefs there was a significant correlation between seawater DMSw concentrations and SST (p {\textless} 0.001), up to temperatures of 30 °C. During coral bleaching DMS flux from reefs almost completely shuts down when SSTs are {\textgreater}30 °C. The GBRL and associated coral reefs emit 439 and 32 MmolS per year, respectively. Cyclones on average produce 170 MmolS to the GBR atmosphere in summer. This amount can markedly increase during severe cyclones such as severe tropical Cyclone Debbie in March 2017. Overall, the annual DMS emission estimate from the GBRL and coral reefs in the GBR is 0.64 GmolS, with cyclones contributing 27\% or greater of the annual emission estimate, depending on the cyclone intensity. Oxidation of atmospheric DMS can potentially affect solar radiation, SSTs, low‐level cloud cover, and rainfall causing cooling and warming of the climate in the GBR region as recent modeling predicts. This study reports the first detailed measurements of the flux and emission of dimethylsulfide (DMS, a trace sulfur gas thought to be involved in climate regulation), from the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon, Coral Sea, and coral reefs that form the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Concentrations of DMS and its main precursor dimethylsulphoniopropionate are greatest at fringing and microatoll reefs, followed by midshelf and barrier reefs on the continental shelf. Seawater DMS and DMS flux are significantly correlated with SST up to temperatures of 30 °C, when production of DMS markedly decreases during coral bleaching. Very low tides increase seawater DMS and dimethylsulphoniopropionate concentrations and can significantly increase the flux of DMS to the atmosphere. There is now increasing evidence that coral reef production of DMS to the atmosphere of the GBR and its effect on the aerosol optical depth could have a significant effect on the climate of NE Australia. Seawater DMS and DMS flux is correlated with SSTs up to temperatures of 30 °C, when production of DMS markedly decreases Seawater DMS, dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), and DMS flux from coral reefs are significantly affected by low and high tides Over 0.6 Gmol of sulfur is emitted into the atmosphere over the GBR per annum where it can potentially affect the climate in the GBR region},

	abstract = {The discipline of seasonal climate prediction began as an exercise in simple statistical techniques. However, today the large government forecast centers almost exclusively rely on complex fully coupled dynamical forecast systems for their subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictions while statistical techniques are mostly neglected and those techniques still in use have not been updated in decades. In this Opinion Article, we argue that new statistical techniques mostly developed outside the field of climate science, collectively referred to as machine learning, can be adopted by climate forecasters to increase the accuracy of S2S predictions. We present an example of where unsupervised learning demonstrates higher accuracy in a seasonal prediction than the state‐of‐the‐art dynamical systems. We also summarize some relevant machine learning methods that are most applicable to climate prediction. Finally, we show by comparing real‐time dynamical model forecasts with observations from winter 2017/2018 that dynamical model forecasts are almost entirely insensitive to polar vortex (PV) variability and the impact on sensible weather. Instead, statistical forecasts more accurately predicted the resultant sensible weather from a mid‐winter PV disruption than the dynamical forecasts. The important implication from the poor dynamical forecasts is that if Arctic change influences mid‐latitude weather through PV variability, then the ability of dynamical models to demonstrate the existence of such a pathway is compromised. We conclude by suggesting that S2S prediction will be most beneficial to the public by incorporating mixed or a hybrid of dynamical forecasts and updated statistical techniques such as machine learning. This article is categorized under: Climate Models and Modeling {\textgreater} Knowledge Generation with Models We argue that statistical techniques should be used more broadly in climate prediction, leading to improved accuracy and guide model development. Prior to winter 2017/2018, a statistical model correctly predicted cold across the continents of the Northern Hemisphere and amplified warmth in the Arctic, which was mostly missing in the dynamical model forecasts.},

Earth system models participating in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) exhibit considerable spread in effective climate sensitivity estimates. Cloud feedbacks are thought to be the cause of this, with marine boundary layer clouds over the Southern Ocean playing an important role. Here, we show that Southern Ocean deep convection is a major contributor to the CMIP6 intermodel spread in effective climate sensitivity. By comparing two Earth system models with very different sensitivities, we find that greater storage of heat at depth can delay the Southern Ocean surface warming and associated cloud response, thereby delaying global surface warming by centuries. The link between Southern Ocean convection and effective climate sensitivity is seen across 41 CMIP6 models, with low-sensitivity models exhibiting substantial deep ocean warming. Our results reveal the influence of Southern Ocean convection on potential long-term climate warming. Southern Ocean deep convection governs the magnitude of long-term warming in response to greenhouse gases, according to an analysis of Earth system models.},

	abstract = {The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) measurements on land, sea, and in the air were designed to provide complementary assessment of chemical, physical, and optical properties of the haze aerosol over the Indian Ocean. Differences in platform requirements and objectives resulted in diverse techniques, measurements, and analyses being employed. In order to best interpret the properties of the INDOEX aerosol, comparisons of data by platform, air mass origin, and light scattering intensity were undertaken. These revealed significant variability in platform averages of aerosol extensive properties (e.g., mass, light scattering, and absorption) but less variability in intensive properties (e.g., mass scattering efficiency, single scattering albedo, backscatter fraction, and Ångström exponent) and the ratios of constituents. In general, ratios of chemical species were found to show greater variability than properties of the size distributions or aerosol optical properties. Even so, at higher haze concentrations with higher scattering values, various determinations of the mass scattering efficiency (MSE) at 33\% relative humidity converged on values of about 3.8 ± 0.3 m2 g−1, providing a firm constraint upon the description and modeling of haze optical properties. MSE values trended lower with more dilute haze but became more variable in clean air or regions of low concentrations. This cross-platform comparison resolved a number of measurement differences but also revealed that regional characterization from different platforms results in differences linked to variability in time and space. This emphasizes the need to combine such efforts with coordinated satellite and modeling studies able to characterize large-scale regional structure and variability. These comparisons also indicate that “closure” between chemical, microphysical, and optical properties across platforms to better than about 20\% will require significant improvements in techniques, calibration procedures, and comparison efforts.},

Aerosol effects on cloud properties and the atmospheric energy and radiation budgets are studied through ensemble simulations over two month-long periods during the NARVAL campaigns (Next-generation Aircraft Remote-Sensing for Validation Studies, December 2013 and August 2016). For each day, two simulations are conducted with low and high cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs), representing low and high aerosol concentrations, respectively. This large data set, which is based on a large spread of co-varying realistic initial conditions, enables robust identification of the effect of CDNC changes on cloud properties. We show that increases in CDNC drive a reduction in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) net shortwave flux (more reflection) and a decrease in the lower-tropospheric stability for all cases examined, while the TOA longwave flux and the liquid and ice water path changes are generally positive. However, changes in cloud fraction or precipitation, that could appear significant for a given day, are not as robustly affected, and, at least for the summer month, are not statistically distinguishable from zero. These results highlight the need for using a large sample of initial conditions for cloud–aerosol studies for identifying the significance of the response. In addition, we demonstrate the dependence of the aerosol effects on the season, as it is shown that the TOA net radiative effect is doubled during the winter month as compared to the summer month. By separating the simulations into different dominant cloud regimes, we show that the difference between the different months emerges due to the compensation of the longwave effect induced by an increase in ice content as compared to the shortwave effect of the liquid clouds. The CDNC effect on the longwave flux is stronger in the summer as the clouds are deeper and the atmosphere is more unstable.},

	abstract = {The Maritime Continent (MC) is an exceedingly complex region from the perspective of both its meteorology and its aerosol characteristics. Convection in the MC is ubiquitous and assumes a wide variety of forms under the influence of an evolving large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic context. Understanding the interaction between convective systems and their environment, both individually and in the aggregate, requires knowledge of the dominant patterns of spatial and temporal variability. Ongoing cloud model ensemble studies require realistic perturbations to the atmospheric thermodynamic state to devise system sensitivities. Apart from modeling studies, evanescent signals in the tropical system are obscured by the underlying broad-scale meteorological variability, which if constrained could illuminate fine-scale physical processes. To this end, radiosonde observations from 2008 to 2016 are examined from three upper-air sounding sites within the MC for the purpose of exploring the dominant vertical temperature, humidity, and wind structures in the region. Principal component analysis is applied to the vertical atmospheric column to transform patterns present in radiosonde data into canonical thermodynamic and wind profiles for the MC. Both rotated and non-rotated principal components are considered, and the emerging structure functions reflect the fundamental vertical modes of short-term tropical variability. The results indicate that while there is tremendous spatial and temporal variability across the MC, the primary modes of vertical thermodynamic and wind variability in the region can be represented in a lower-dimensional subspace. In addition, the vertical structures are very similar among different sites around the region, though different structures may manifest more strongly at one location than another. The results indicate that, while different meteorology may be found in various parts of the MC at any given time, the processes themselves are remarkably consistent. The ability to represent this variability using a limited number of structure functions facilitates analysis of covariability between atmospheric structure and convective systems and also enables future systematic model-based ensemble analysis of cloud development, convection, and precipitation over the MC.},

The majority of the remaining 0.17\&amp;\#8201;W\&amp;\#8201;m\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;2\&lt;/sup\&gt; is likely to be from ozone. As determined in previous studies, cancellation of tropospheric and surface adjustments means that the \&lt;q\&gt;traditional\&lt;/q\&gt; stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing is approximately equal to ERF for greenhouse gas forcing, but not for aerosols, and consequentially, not for the anthropogenic total. The spread of aerosol forcing ranges from \&amp;\#8722;0.63 to \&amp;\#8722;1.37\&amp;\#8201;W\&amp;\#8201;m\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;2\&lt;/sup\&gt;, exhibiting a less negative mean and narrower range compared to 10 CMIP5 models.

Aerosol forcing is uncorrelated with equilibrium climate sensitivity. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the increasing spread in climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models, particularly related to high-sensitivity models, is a consequence of a stronger negative present-day aerosol forcing.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Substepping the cloud condensation (macrophysics) within a time step improves single-column results. Simulations of mixed-phase cases are strongly sensitive to ice nucleation. The new microphysics alters process rates in both single-column and global simulations, even at low (200 km) horizontal resolution. Thus, prognostic precipitation can be important, even in low-resolution simulations where advection of precipitation is not important. Accretion dominates as liquid water path increases in agreement with cloud-resolving model simulations and estimates from observations. The new microphysics with prognostic precipitation increases the ratio of accretion over autoconversion. The change in process rates appears to significantly reduce aerosol–cloud interactions and indirect radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols by up to 33\% (depending on substepping) to below 1 W m−2 of cooling between simulations with preindustrial (1850) and present-day (2000) aerosol emissions.},

	abstract = {Increases in cloud optical depth and liquid water path (LWP) are robust features of global warming model simulations in high latitudes, yielding a negative shortwave cloud feedback, but the mechanisms are still uncertain. Here the importance of microphysical processes for the negative optical depth feedback is assessed by perturbing temperature in the microphysics schemes of two aquaplanet models, both of which have separate prognostic equations for liquid water and ice. It is found that most of the LWP increase with warming is caused by a suppression of ice microphysical processes in mixed-phase clouds, resulting in reduced conversion efficiencies of liquid water to ice and precipitation. Perturbing the temperature-dependent phase partitioning of convective condensate also yields a small LWP increase. Together, the perturbations in large-scale microphysics and convective condensate partitioning explain more than two-thirds of the LWP response relative to a reference case with increased SSTs, and capture all of the vertical structure of the liquid water response. In support of these findings, a very robust positive relationship between monthly mean LWP and temperature in CMIP5 models and observations is shown to exist in mixed-phase cloud regions only. In models, the historical LWP sensitivity to temperature is a good predictor of the forced global warming response poleward of about 45°, although models appear to overestimate the LWP response to warming compared to observations. The results indicate that in climate models, the suppression of ice-phase microphysical processes that deplete cloud liquid water is a key driver of the LWP increase with warming and of the associated negative shortwave cloud feedback.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

It produces a profound affect on tropical climate by shading the underlying ocean and radiatively cooling and stirring up turbulence in the atmosphere. In October 2001, the East Pacific Investigation of Climate undertook an exploratory cruise from the Galapagos Islands to Chile. The cruise gathered an unprecedented dataset, integrating radiosonde, surface, cloud remote sensing, aerosol, and ocean measurements. Scientific objectives included measuring the vertical structure of the ABL in this region, understanding what physical processes are determining the stra-tocumulus cloud albedo, and understanding the fluxes of heat and water that couple the atmosphere and ocean in this region. An unexpectedly well-mixed stratocumulus-capped boundary layer as a result of a strong inversion was encountered throughout. A strong diurnal cycle was observed, with thicker clouds and substantial drizzle (mainly evaporating above the sea surface) during the late night and early morning. This was driven in part by local diabatic processes, and was reinforced by a surprisingly pronounced diurnal cycle of vertical motion. The vertical motion appears to be an inertia–gravity wave driven by daytime heating over South America that propagates over 1000 km offshore. Much more nocturnal drizzle and pronounced me-soscale cellularity were observed in “clean” conditions when cloud droplet concentrations and aerosol concentrations were low. Entrainment of dry, warm air is inferred to be the primary regulator of cloud thickness in this region, but drizzle also appears to have a large indirect impact by inhibiting and changing the spatial organization of turbulence.},

Clouds play a critical role in moderating global temperatures and small perturbations can lead to significant amounts of cooling or warming. Uncertainty in this effect is so large it is not currently known if it is negligible, or provides a large enough cooling to largely negate present-day warming by CO2.

An alternate approach is to use horizontal statistics (e.g., cloud mass flux, cloud fraction, and precipitation) from the CRM simulation to drive a single-column parameterization of cloud effects on the aerosol and then use the aerosol profile to simulate aerosol effects on clouds within the CRM. Here, we present results from the first component of the Explicit-Cloud Parameterized-Pollutant parameterization to be developed, which handles vertical transport of tracers by clouds. A CRM with explicit tracer transport serves as a benchmark. We show that this parameterization, driven by the CRM's cloud mass fluxes, reproduces the CRM tracer transport significantly better than a single-column model that uses a conventional convective cloud parameterization.},

We show that cloud-top height and thickness increase with aerosol concentration measured near the ground in mixed-phase clouds—which contain both liquid water and ice—that have a warm, low base. We attribute the effect, which is most significant in summer, to an aerosol-induced invigoration of upward winds. In contrast, we find no change in cloud-top height and precipitation with aerosol concentration in clouds with no ice or cool bases. We further show that precipitation frequency and rain rate are altered by aerosols. Rain increases with aerosol concentration in deep clouds that have a high liquid-water content, but declines in clouds that have a low liquid-water content. Simulations using a cloud-resolving model confirm these observations. Our findings provide unprecedented insights of the long-term net impacts of aerosols on clouds and precipitation.},

It is thought that the aerosol can affect the ability of clouds to form precipitation and in turn cloudiness. But how, in detail, do clouds — and through them the radiative forcing of the global climate system — depend on the aerosol? Bjorn Stevens and Graham Feingold propose that past difficulties in untangling relationships between the aerosol, clouds and precipitation reflect in part a failure to take into account the many processes that act to buffer cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol perturbations. To counter this, say Stevens and Feingold, research needs to focus on understanding specific regimes of aerosol, cloud and precipitation. It is thought that changes in the concentration of cloud-active aerosol can alter the precipitation efficiency of clouds, thereby changing cloud amount and, hence, the radiative forcing of the climate system. Despite decades of research, it has proved frustratingly difficult to establish climatically meaningful relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation. As a result, the climatic effect of the aerosol remains controversial. We propose that the difficulty in untangling relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation reflects the inadequacy of existing tools and methodologies and a failure to account for processes that buffer cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol perturbations.},

The GOES-derived total cloud fractions for both 0.5° and 2.5° grid boxes are in excellent agreement with surface observations, suggesting that ARM point observations can represent large areal observations. Low ({\textless}2 km), middle (2–6 km), and high ({\textgreater}6 km) levels of cloud fractions, however, have negative biases as compared to the ARM results due to multilayer cloud scenes that can either mask lower cloud layers or cause misidentifications of cloud tops. Compared to the ARM observations, the SCM simulated most midlevel clouds, overestimated low clouds (4\%), and underestimated total and high clouds by 7\% and 15\%, respectively. To examine the dependence of the modeled high and low clouds on the large-scale synoptic patterns, variables such as relative humidity (RH) and vertical pressure velocity (omega) from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data are included. The successfully modeled and missed high clouds are primarily associated with a trough and ridge upstream of the ARM SGP, respectively. The PDFs of observed high and low occurrence as a function of RH reveal that high clouds have a Gaussian-like distribution with mode RH values of ∼40\%–50\%, whereas low clouds have a gammalike distribution with the highest cloud probability occurring at RH ∼75\%–85\%. The PDFs of modeled low clouds are similar to those observed; however, for high clouds the PDFs are shifted toward higher values of RH. This results in a negative bias for the modeled high clouds because many of the observed clouds occur at RH values below the SCM-specified stratiform parameterization threshold RH of 60\%. Despite many similarities between PDFs derived from the NARR and ARM forcing datasets for RH and omega, differences do exist. This warrants further investigation of the forcing and reanalysis datasets.},

	abstract = {Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China instituted shutdown measures starting in late January and continuing into February 2020 to arrest the spread of disease. This resulted in a sharp economic contraction unparalleled in recent Chinese history. Satellite retrievals show that nitrogen dioxide pollution declined by an unprecedented amount ({\textasciitilde}50\% regionally) from its expected unperturbed value, but regional‐scale column aerosol loadings and cloud microphysical properties were not detectably affected. The disparate impact is tied to differential economic impacts of the shutdown, in which transportation, a disproportionate source of nitrogen oxide emissions, underwent drastic declines ({\textasciitilde}90\% reductions in passenger traffic), whereas industry and power generation, responsible for {\textgreater}90\% of particulate emissions, were relatively less affected ({\textasciitilde}20\% reductions in electricity and thermal power generation). A combination of anomalously warm and humid meteorological conditions and complex chemical interactions further decreased nitrogen dioxide concentrations but likely enhanced secondary aerosol formation. To slow the spread of COVID‐19, China implemented strict policies limiting travel and public gatherings in February 2020, resulting in a pronounced economic decline. Satellite measurements show that levels of nitrogen oxides, gases that are a major component of air pollution, were substantially lower than what we would normally expect for February. Surprisingly, however, we did not observe any similar changes in airborne particles (another major component of air pollution) or in the size of cloud droplets (which is partly determined by the abundance of airborne particles). This is important because airborne particles, in addition to harming human health, affect the climate by changing how much sunlight is absorbed on Earth versus reflected back into space. The transportation sector of the economy was hit particularly hard by the coronavirus shutdown, but heavy industries and power plants were relatively less affected. Transportation is a major source of nitrogen oxides but not of airborne particles or their chemical precursors, which are mostly emitted by industry and power plants. The shutdown's much larger effect on transportation than on industry or power plants, along with changes in weather and chemical interactions, help explain the differences we see in the different types of air pollution. Rapid economic collapse in February 2020 due to the COVID‐19 pandemic and partial recovery in March 2020 are unique in recent Chinese history Regional decline in NO2 pollution is unprecedented in the satellite record, but no change in aerosol or cloud properties is detected Different economic impacts by sector, meteorology, and complex chemical interactions help explain differences in NOx and aerosol response},

	abstract = {Different climate drivers influence precipitation in different ways. Here we use radiative kernels to understand the influence of rapid adjustment processes on precipitation in climate models. Rapid adjustments are generally triggered by the initial heating or cooling of the atmosphere from an external climate driver. For precipitation changes, rapid adjustments due to changes in temperature, water vapor, and clouds are most important. In this study we have investigated five climate drivers (CO2, CH4, solar irradiance, black carbon, and sulfate aerosols). The fast precipitation responses to a doubling of CO2 and a 10‐fold increase in black carbon are found to be similar, despite very different instantaneous changes in the radiative cooling, individual rapid adjustments, and sensible heating. The model diversity in rapid adjustments is smaller for the experiment involving an increase in the solar irradiance compared to the other climate driver perturbations, and this is also seen in the precipitation changes. Future projections of precipitation changes are uncertain, both on regional and global scales. Understanding the climate models' diversity of precipitation change and how these models respond to various climate drivers, such as greenhouse gases and aerosols, is a key topic in climate research. Using sophisticated techniques, we quantify the processes altering precipitation changes on a short time scale and show that changes in the vertical profile of temperature, water vapor, and clouds contribute very differently to precipitation changes for various climate drivers. Our results show that model diversity in precipitation changes varies strongly between the climate drivers. Separation of instantaneous and rapid adjustment contributions to precipitation changes Contributions of rapid adjustments to precipitation changes differ substantially between climate drivers Radiative kernels are applied to understand individual rapid adjustment terms},

Previously-described click types for eight known odontocete species or genera were identified in this data set: Blainville’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris), Cuvier’s beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), Gervais’ beaked whales (Mesoplodon europaeus), Sowerby’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens), and True’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon mirus), Kogia spp., Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Six novel delphinid echolocation click types were identified and named according to their median peak frequencies. Consideration of the spatiotemporal distribution of these unidentified click types, and comparison to historical sighting data, enabled assignment of the probable species identity to three of the six types, and group identity to a fourth type. UD36, UD26, and UD28 were attributed to Risso’s dolphin (G. griseus), short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus), and short-beaked common dolphin (D. delphis), respectively, based on similar regional distributions and seasonal presence patterns. UD19 was attributed to one or more species in the subfamily Globicephalinae based on spectral content and signal timing. UD47 and UD38 represent distinct types for which no clear spatiotemporal match was apparent. This approach leveraged the power of big acoustic and big visual data to add to the catalog of known species-specific acoustic signals and yield new inferences about odontocete spatiotemporal distribution patterns. The tools and call types described here can be used for efficient analysis of other existing and future passive acoustic data sets from this region.},

This forcing is determined, inter alia, by the cloud liquid water path (LWP), which we analyze using a combination of Gaussian process emulation and mixed-layer theory. For nocturnal, non-precipitating stratocumuli, we show that LWP steady states constitute an equilibrium primarily between radiative cooling and entrainment warming and drying. These steady states are approached from lower LWPs due to reduced entrainment, while higher LWPs are depleted by stronger entrainment. An analytical solution for the LWP steady state reveals not only the environmental conditions in which a stratocumulus cloud can be maintained, but also distinct analytical properties of the entrainment velocity that are required for a stable LWP steady state that opposes perturbations. In particular, the results highlight the importance of an entrainment velocity that increases strictly monotonically with the LWP if stratocumuli are to attain a stable LWP steady state. This is demonstrated through analysis of two commonly used mixed-layer entrainment parameterizations.},

Much of the uncertainty in the direct aerosol forcing can be attributed to uncertainty in the anthropogenic fraction of aerosol in the present‐day atmosphere, due to a lack of historical observations. Here, we present a robust relationship between total present‐day aerosol optical depth and the anthropogenic contribution across three multimodel ensembles and a large single‐model perturbed parameter ensemble. Using observations of aerosol optical depth, we determine a reduced likely range of the anthropogenic component and hence a reduced uncertainty in the direct forcing of aerosol. Despite the impacts of global warming already being felt around the world, it is still unclear how much of the effect of greenhouse gasses is being offset by the cooling effect of atmospheric aerosol through the scattering of incoming sunlight and the modification of clouds. A large part of the difficulty in determining the effect of aerosol is in understanding the proportion of present‐day aerosol that is due to human activity. In this work, we demonstrate a strong relationship between the total amount of aerosol in the present‐day atmosphere (something we can measure) and the amount due to human activity (something we cannot). We further show that this allows us to reduce the uncertainty in the cooling effect of aerosols. A strong relationship is demonstrated between total present‐day aerosol loading and the anthropogenic contribution, across a variety of models Observations of the total present‐day aerosol loading are thus used to constrain uncertainty in anthropogenic aerosol and aerosol direct forcing Applying these constraints to one million samples of a 26‐parameter perturbed parameter ensemble leads to a clear‐sky RFari estimate of −0.69 ± 0.14 Wm−2},

LASSO is designed to overcome an oft-shared difficulty of bridging the gap from point-based measurements to scales relevant for model parameterization development, and it provides an approach to add value to observations through modeling. LASSO is envisioned to be useful to modelers, theoreticians, and observationalists needing information relevant to cloud processes. LASSO does so by combining a suite of observations, LES inputs and outputs, diagnostics, and skill scores into data bundles that are freely available, and by simplifying user access to the data to speed scientific inquiry. The combination of relevant observations with observationally constrained LES output provides detail that gives context to the observations by showing physically consistent connections between processes based on the simulated state. A unique approach for LASSO is the generation of a library of cases for days with shallow convection combined with an ensemble of LES for each case. The library enables researchers to move beyond the single-case-study approach typical of LES research. The ensemble members are produced using a selection of different large-scale forcing sources and spatial scales. Since large-scale forcing is one of the most uncertain aspects of generating the LES, the ensemble informs users about potential uncertainty for each date and increases the probability of having an accurate forcing for each case.},

One example is our inability to provide robust assessments of future global and regional climate changes. However, ongoing advances in our capacity to observe, simulate and conceptualize the climate system now make it possible to fill gaps in our knowledge. We argue that progress can be accelerated by focusing research on a handful of important scientific questions that have become tractable as a result of recent advances.

	abstract = {How Earth's climate reacts to anthropogenic forcing is one of the most burning questions faced by today's scientific community. A leading source of uncertainty in estimating this sensitivity is related to the response of clouds. Under the canonical climate-change perspective of forcings and feedbacks, the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds is categorized under the forcing component, while the modifications of the radiative properties of clouds due to climate change are considered in the feedback component. Each of these components contributes the largest portion of uncertainty to its relevant category and is largely studied separately from the other. In this paper, using idealized cloud-resolving radiative–convective-equilibrium simulations, with a slab ocean model, we show that aerosol–cloud interactions could affect cloud feedback. Specifically, we show that equilibrium climate sensitivity increases under high aerosol concentration due to an increase in the short-wave cloud feedback. The short-wave cloud feedback is enhanced under high-aerosol conditions due to a stronger increase in the precipitation efficiency with warming, which can be explained by higher sensitivity of the droplet size and the cloud water content to the CO2 concentration rise. These results indicate a possible connection between cloud feedback and aerosol–cloud interactions.},

We use an intermediate complexity AOGCM to perform an ensemble of simulations for a range of greenhouse gas concentration profiles and model parameters. We decompose climate change fields into a series of spatial patterns and then derive the functional dependence of the dominant patterns on model input. This allows us to rapidly reconstruct a good approximation to the simulated change from an arbitrary concentration profile (without the need for further simulation).

	abstract = {Controls on pristine aerosol over the Southern Ocean (SO) are critical for constraining the strength of global aerosol indirect forcing. Observations of summertime SO clouds and aerosols in synoptically varied conditions during the 2018 SOCRATES aircraft campaign reveal novel mechanisms influencing pristine aerosol‐cloud interactions. The SO free troposphere (3–6 km) is characterized by widespread, frequent new particle formation events contributing to much larger concentrations (≥1,000 mg−1) of condensation nuclei (diameters {\textgreater} 0.01 μm) than in typical sub‐tropical regions. Synoptic‐scale uplift in warm conveyor belts and sub‐polar vortices lifts marine biogenic sulfur‐containing gases to free‐tropospheric environments favorable for generating Aitken‐mode aerosol particles (0.01–0.1 μm). Free‐tropospheric Aitken particles subside into the boundary layer, where they grow in size to dominate the sulfur‐based cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) driving SO cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd ∼ 60–100 cm−3). Evidence is presented for a hypothesized Aitken‐buffering mechanism which maintains persistently high summertime SO Nd against precipitation removal through CCN replenishment from activation and growth of boundary layer Aitken particles. Nudged hindcasts from the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6) are found to underpredict Aitken and accumulation mode aerosols and Nd, impacting summertime cloud brightness and aerosol‐cloud interactions and indicating incomplete representations of aerosol mechanisms associated with ocean biology. The remote Southern Ocean (SO) is a unique analog to pre‐industrial environments due to limited continental and anthropogenic influences. Understanding how aerosols are produced in this region and their influence on cloud droplet concentrations is vital for understanding how much sunlight these clouds reflect to space, which affects ocean temperatures and global climate. This is a key uncertainty in modeling past and future climate change due to anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. To understand this pristine environment, we analyze novel observations of SO clouds and aerosols from a summertime aircraft campaign. We present evidence for an aerosol production mechanism driven by synoptic storms and sourced from emissions of ocean biology. This mechanism produces a reservoir of small aerosols above cloud that subside into the marine boundary layer, where they grow into cloud‐affecting sizes and control cloud droplet number. In addition to acting as a source of boundary layer aerosol, these small particles help SO clouds to resist precipitation depletion of cloud‐affecting aerosol, maintaining surprisingly high cloud droplet number concentrations that help to keep present‐day SO clouds persistently bright. This mechanism has important implications for understanding pre‐industrial and other pristine environments and their response to anthropogenic aerosol.

The radiative forcing of climate exerted by anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, derived mainly from SO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion, is opposite that due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases and is estimated to be of comparable average magnitude in Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. However, persuasive evidence of climate response to this forcing has thus far been lacking. Here we examine patterns of seasonal and latitudinal variations in temperature anomaly trend for evidence of such a response. Pronounced minima in the rate of temperature increase in summer months in Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes are consistent with the latitudinal distribution of anthropogenic sulfate and changes in the rate of SO2 emissions over the industrial era.},

	abstract = {The rate of global surface warming is crucial for tracking progress towards global climate targets, but is strongly influenced by interannual-to-decadal variability, which precludes rapid detection of the temperature response to emission mitigation. Here we use a physics based Green’s function approach to filter out modulations to global mean surface temperature from sea-surface temperature (SST) patterns, and show that it results in an earlier emergence of a response to strong emissions mitigation. For observed temperatures, we find a filtered 2011–2020 surface warming rate of 0.24 °C per decade, consistent with long-term trends. Unfiltered observations show 0.35 °C per decade, partly due to the El Nino of 2015–2016. Pattern filtered warming rates can become a strong tool for the climate community to inform policy makers and stakeholder communities about the ongoing and expected climate responses to emission reductions, provided an effort is made to improve and validate standardized Green’s functions. The pattern of sea surface temperatures affects global mean temperatures from year to year. By filtering out parts of this natural variability, researchers show that they can more rapidly detect the influence of mitigation of CO2 emissions on the climate},

	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis of atmospheric models is necessary to identify the processes that lead to uncertainty in model predictions, to help understand model diversity through comparison of driving processes, and to prioritise research. Assessing the effect of parameter uncertainty in complex models is challenging and often limited by CPU constraints. Here we present a cost-effective application of variance-based sensitivity analysis to quantify the sensitivity of a 3-D global aerosol model to uncertain parameters. A Gaussian process emulator is used to estimate the model output across multi-dimensional parameter space, using information from a small number of model runs at points chosen using a Latin hypercube space-filling design. Gaussian process emulation is a Bayesian approach that uses information from the model runs along with some prior assumptions about the model behaviour to predict model output everywhere in the uncertainty space. We use the Gaussian process emulator to calculate the percentage of expected output variance explained by uncertainty in global aerosol model parameters and their interactions. To demonstrate the technique, we show examples of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) sensitivity to 8 model parameters in polluted and remote marine environments as a function of altitude. In the polluted environment 95 \% of the variance of CCN concentration is described by uncertainty in the 8 parameters (excluding their interaction effects) and is dominated by the uncertainty in the sulphur emissions, which explains 80 \% of the variance. However, in the remote region parameter interaction effects become important, accounting for up to 40 \% of the total variance. Some parameters are shown to have a negligible individual effect but a substantial interaction effect. Such sensitivities would not be detected in the commonly used single parameter perturbation experiments, which would therefore underpredict total uncertainty. Gaussian process emulation is shown to be an efficient and useful technique for quantifying parameter sensitivity in complex global atmospheric models.},

	abstract = {The response of climate to external forcing is known as climate sensitivity, and its estimates are calculated from historical observations. This study estimates the efficacy of individual forcings and revises climate sensitivities accordingly. Climate sensitivity to doubled CO2 is a widely used metric for the large-scale response to external forcing. Climate models predict a wide range for two commonly used definitions: the transient climate response (TCR: the warming after 70 years of CO2 concentrations that rise at 1\% per year), and the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS: the equilibrium temperature change following a doubling of CO2 concentrations). Many observational data sets have been used to constrain these values, including temperature trends over the recent past1,2,3,4,5,6, inferences from palaeoclimate7,8 and process-based constraints from the modern satellite era9,10. However, as the IPCC recently reported11, different classes of observational constraints produce somewhat incongruent ranges. Here we show that climate sensitivity estimates derived from recent observations must account for the efficacy of each forcing active during the historical period. When we use single-forcing experiments to estimate these efficacies and calculate climate sensitivity from the observed twentieth-century warming, our estimates of both TCR and ECS are revised upwards compared to previous studies, improving the consistency with independent constraints.},

We adopt a hybrid approach by marrying two well-established turbulent flow simulation techniques with deep learning. Specifically, we introduce trainable spectral filters in a coupled model of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), followed by a specialized U-net for prediction. Our approach, which we call Turbulent-Flow Net, is grounded in a principled physics model, yet offers the flexibility of learned representations. We compare our model with state-of-the-art baselines and observe significant reductions in error for predictions 60 frames ahead. Most importantly, our method predicts physical fields that obey desirable physical characteristics, such as conservation of mass, whilst faithfully emulating the turbulent kinetic energy field and spectrum, which are critical for accurate prediction of turbulent flows.},

The mean states of liquid water potential temperature, total water, and velocity field exhibit negligible change between all LES runs, offering the perfect opportunity to investigate microphysical–dynamical interactions solely due to variations in aerosol concentration and not changes in meteorology. As aerosol concentration increases, two cloud population responses are found: 1) cloud and cloud-core widths decrease while their strength increases and 2) cloud and core numbers increase. The narrowing of the polluted clouds is caused by enhanced evaporation rates surrounding the cloud cores, which in turn shrinks the diameter of the cumulus toroidal circulation. The more narrow toroidal circulation in polluted clouds has a faster rise rate and imparts weaker dynamical entrainment on the cloud cores, resulting in stronger clouds as aerosol concentration increases. The reduction in cloud number for more pristine conditions occurs from greater cold pool coverage, reducing the likelihood of subcloud-layer thermals reaching their lifting condensation level. The increase in cloud number as aerosol concentration increases is compensated by narrower and stronger clouds, resulting in a cumulus-core mass flux that appears to be unaffected by aerosol concentration variability. For the weakly precipitating case studied here, the trends in the response of the cumulus clouds to aerosol concentration are found to be insensitive to domain size.},

	abstract = {Limiting global warming to 1.5 or 2.0°C requires strong mitigation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Concurrently, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols will decline, due to coemission with GHG, and measures to improve air quality. However, the combined climate effect of GHG and aerosol emissions over the industrial era is poorly constrained. Here we show the climate impacts from removing present‐day anthropogenic aerosol emissions and compare them to the impacts from moderate GHG‐dominated global warming. Removing aerosols induces a global mean surface heating of 0.5–1.1°C, and precipitation increase of 2.0–4.6\%. Extreme weather indices also increase. We find a higher sensitivity of extreme events to aerosol reductions, per degree of surface warming, in particular over the major aerosol emission regions. Under near‐term warming, we find that regional climate change will depend strongly on the balance between aerosol and GHG forcing. To keep within 1.5 or 2° of global warming, we need massive reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, aerosol emissions will be strongly reduced. We show how cleaning up aerosols, predominantly sulfate, may add an additional half a degree of global warming, with impacts that strengthen those from greenhouse gas warming. The northern hemisphere is found to be more sensitive to aerosol removal than greenhouse gas warming, because of where the aerosols are emitted today. This means that it does not only matter whether or not we reach international climate targets. It also matters how we get there. Aerosol emission removal can warm the climate by more than 0.5°C Key climate variables are more sensitive to aerosol removal than to GHG increase Regional impacts of 1.5°C warming depend on the balance between aerosol and GHG forcing},

This can modify the reflected solar radiation and the thermal radiation emitted to space. Measurements of tropospheric CCN and IN over large areas have not been possible and can be only roughly approximated from satellite-sensor-based estimates of optical properties of aerosols. Our lack of ability to measure both CCN and cloud updrafts precludes disentangling the effects of meteorology from those of aerosols and represents the largest component in our uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. Ways to improve the retrieval accuracy include multiangle and multipolarimetric passive measurements of the optical signal and multispectral lidar polarimetric measurements. Indirect methods include proxies of trace gases, as retrieved by hyperspectral sensors. Perhaps the most promising emerging direction is retrieving the CCN properties by simultaneously retrieving convective cloud drop number concentrations and updraft speeds, which amounts to using clouds as natural CCN chambers. These satellite observations have to be constrained by in situ observations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation-climate (ACPC) interactions, which in turn constrain a hierarchy of model simulations of ACPC. Since the essence of a general circulation model is an accurate quantification of the energy and mass fluxes in all forms between the surface, atmosphere and outer space, a route to progress is proposed here in the form of a series of box flux closure experiments in the various climate regimes. A roadmap is provided for quantifying the ACPC interactions and thereby reducing the uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing.},

	abstract = {A Perturbed Parameter Ensemble (PPE) with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) is used to better understand the sensitivity of aerosol forcing and cloud feedbacks to changes in model processes. Aerosol forcing through aerosol‐cloud interactions is mostly negative (a cooling) due to shortwave radiation, while feedbacks are positive or negative in different regions due to contrasting longwave and shortwave effects. Both forcing and feedbacks are related to the mean climate state. Higher magnitude cloud radiative effects generally mean larger magnitude net negative forcing and larger magnitude net positive feedback. Aerosol forcing is broadly related to the susceptibility of clouds to drop number. Feedbacks also related to susceptibility, but to a lesser extent and in different regions to aerosol forcing. Aerosol forcing and cloud feedbacks are anti‐correlated in the CAM6 PPE such that stronger negative forcing is associated with stronger positive feedbacks. Even the processes governing forcing and feedback sensitivity in the PPE are similar. These include the warm rain formation process, ice loss processes and deep convective intensity. A climate model is run many times with modified parameters to see how the parameters affect key aspects of climate change. The paper focuses on two aspects of climate change. First, the cloud response to aerosol particles tends to create a cooling, which partially offsets greenhouse gas warming, but the magnitude of the cooling is not well known. It varies a lot in the model when parameters are changed. Second, the paper examines the cloud response to surface temperature increases, called cloud feedbacks, which are the largest uncertainty in estimating the level of future climate change. Cloud feedbacks are also sensitive to parameters. The results show that the cloud feedbacks and aerosol forcing changes are similar but opposite in the model: the cooling and warming generally increase together. This occurs because they are linked to similar parameters, which indicate sensitivity to critical processes, including how rain forms, and how much ice is in the atmosphere. Parametric uncertainty of Aerosol Forcing and Cloud Feedbacks are large Aerosol Forcing and Cloud Feedbacks are related through cloud processes and depend on the mean state of clouds Warm rain formation and ice processes are critical sensitivities that couple forcing and feedback Parametric uncertainty of Aerosol Forcing and Cloud Feedbacks are large Aerosol Forcing and Cloud Feedbacks are related through cloud processes and depend on the mean state of clouds Warm rain formation and ice processes are critical sensitivities that couple forcing and feedback},

While neural networks can achieve state-of-the-art performance, they are typically climate model-specific, require post-hoc tools for interpretation, and struggle to predict outside of their training distribution. To avoid these limitations, we combine symbolic regression, sequential feature selection, and physical constraints in a hierarchical modeling framework. This framework allows us to discover new equations diagnosing cloud cover from coarse-grained variables of global storm-resolving model simulations. These analytical equations are interpretable by construction and easily transferable to other grids or climate models. Our best equation balances performance and complexity, achieving a performance comparable to that of neural networks (\$R{\textasciicircum}2=0.94\$) while remaining simple (with only 13 trainable parameters). It reproduces cloud cover distributions more accurately than the Xu-Randall scheme across all cloud regimes (Hellinger distances \${\textless}0.09\$), and matches neural networks in condensate-rich regimes. When applied and fine-tuned to the ERA5 reanalysis, the equation exhibits superior transferability to new data compared to all other optimal cloud cover schemes. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of symbolic regression in discovering interpretable, physically-consistent, and nonlinear equations to parameterize cloud cover.},

It was previously shown that aerosol‐radiation interactions lead to a reduction in the global‐mean precipitation amount. We have further demonstrated in aqua‐planet simulations that the local response to absorbing aerosols differs between the tropics and the extra‐tropics. In this study we incorporate an energy budget perspective to further examine the latitudinal‐dependence of the effect of aerosol‐radiation interaction on precipitation in idealized global simulations. We demonstrate that the transition between a positive local precipitation response in the tropics and a negative local precipitation response in the extra‐tropics occurs at relatively low latitudes (∼10°), indicating a transition between the deep‐tropics (in which the Coriolis force is low, hence direct thermally driven circulation, and associated divergence/convergence of energy/moisture, can form as a result of the diabatic‐heating) and their surroundings. In addition, we gradually increase the level of complexity of the simulations and demonstrate that, in the case of absorbing aerosols, the effect of land is to counteract some of the response both inside and outside the deep‐tropics due to the reduction in surface latent‐heat flux that opposes the diabatic‐heating. The effect of scattering aerosols is also examined and demonstrates a decrease in precipitation over land in both the tropics and extra‐tropics and no effect over the ocean. Finally, we examine these results in a more realistic set‐up and demonstrate that, although the physical mechanisms still operate, they are not significant enough to be discerned from the model’s natural‐variability.

In contrast with GFDL's CM4.0 development effort that focuses on ocean resolution for physical climate, ESM4.1 focuses on comprehensiveness of Earth system interactions. ESM4.1 features doubled horizontal resolution of both atmosphere (2° to 1°) and ocean (1° to 0.5°) relative to GFDL's previous‐generation coupled ESM2‐carbon and CM3‐chemistry models. ESM4.1 brings together key representational advances in CM4.0 dynamics and physics along with those in aerosols and their precursor emissions, land ecosystem vegetation and canopy competition, and multiday fire; ocean ecological and biogeochemical interactions, comprehensive land‐atmosphere‐ocean cycling of CO2, dust and iron, and interactive ocean‐atmosphere nitrogen cycling are described in detail across this volume of JAMES and presented here in terms of the overall coupling and resulting fidelity. ESM4.1 provides much improved fidelity in CO2 and chemistry over ESM2 and CM3, captures most of CM4.0's baseline simulations characteristics, and notably improves on CM4.0 in (1) Southern Ocean mode and intermediate water ventilation, (2) Southern Ocean aerosols, and (3) reduced spurious ocean heat uptake. ESM4.1 has reduced transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity compared to CM4.0. Fidelity concerns include (1) moderate degradation in sea surface temperature biases, (2) degradation in aerosols in some regions, and (3) strong centennial scale climate modulation by Southern Ocean convection. GFDL has developed a coupled chemistry‐carbon‐climate Earth System Model (ESM4.1) as part of its fourth‐generation coupled model development activities with model results contributed publicly to the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. With similar computational expense as GFDL's first coupled model CM4.0, ESM4.1 focuses on chemistry and ecosystem comprehensiveness rather than the ocean resolution‐focus of CM4.0. With fidelity near to that of CM4.0, ESM4.1 features much improved representation of climate mean patterns and variability from previous GFDL ESMs as well as comprehensive couplings for chemistry, carbon, and dust. A new coupled chemistry‐carbon‐climate Earth system model has been developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory This model unifies component advances in chemistry, carbon, and ecosystem comprehensiveness within a single coupled climate framework This model features much improved climate mean patterns and variability from previous chemistry and carbon coupled models},

For the pyramidal dots we find that the hydrostatic strain is mostly confined in the QD; in contrast part of the anisotropic strain is transferred from the QD into the barrier. The optical-phonon energies in the QD are estimated and agree perfectly with recent experimental findings. From the variation of the strain tensor the local band-gap modification is calculated. Piezoelectric effects are additionally taken into account. The three-dimensional effective-mass single-particle Schrödinger equation is solved for electrons and holes using the realistic confinement potentials. Since the QD’s are in the strong confinement regime, the Coulomb interaction can be treated as a perturbation. The thus obtained electronic structure agrees with luminescence data.

Here we study the extent to which observations of the climate system agree with these ERF assumptions. We use a large ERF ensemble from the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) to attribute the anthropogenic contributions to global mean surface temperature (GMST), top-of-atmosphere radiative flux, and we use aerosol optical depth observations. The GMST trend has increased from +0.18°C decade −1 in 2000–09 to +0.35°C decade −1 in 2010–19, coinciding with the anthropogenic warming trend rising from +0.19°C decade −1 in 2000–09 to +0.24°C decade −1 in 2010–19. This, as well as observed trends in top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes and aerosol optical depths, supports the claim of an aerosol-induced temporary acceleration in the rate of warming. However, all three observation datasets additionally suggest that smaller aerosol ERF trend changes are compatible with observations since 2000, since radiative flux and GMST trends are significantly influenced by internal variability over this period. A zero-trend-change aerosol ERF scenario results in a much smaller anthropogenic warming acceleration since 2000 but is poorly represented in AR6’s ERF ensemble. Short-term ERF trends are difficult to verify using observations, so caution is required in predictions or policy judgments that depend on them, such as estimates of current anthropogenic warming trend, and the time remaining to, or the outstanding carbon budget consistent with, 1.5°C warming. Further systematic research focused on quantifying trends and early identification of acceleration or deceleration is required.},

The GLObal Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) aerosol microphysics scheme, already used in the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 3 (HadGEM3) climate configuration, is coupled to the Cloud AeroSol Interacting Microphysics (CASIM) cloud microphysics scheme. We demonstrate the performance of the new configuration in high-resolution simulations of a case study defined from the CLARIFY aircraft campaign in 2017 near Ascension Island in the tropical southern Atlantic. We improve the physical basis of the activation scheme by representing the effect of existing cloud droplets on the activation of new aerosol, and we also discuss the effect of unresolved vertical velocities. We show that neglect of these two competing effects in previous studies led to compensating errors but realistic droplet concentrations. While these changes lead only to a modest improvement in model performance, they reinforce our confidence in the ability of the model microphysics code to simulate the aerosol–cloud microphysical interactions it was designed to represent. Capturing these interactions accurately is critical to simulating aerosol effects on climate.},

By applying the same inversion algorithm as used for obtaining size distributions with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), CCN concentration and activated droplet size are obtained as a function of mobility size over the timescale of an SMPS scan (typically 60–120 s). Methods to account for multiple charging, particle non-sphericity, and limited counting statistics are presented. SMCA is demonstrated using commercial SMPS and CFSTGC instruments with the manufacturer-provided control software. The method is evaluated for activation of both laboratory aerosol and ambient aerosol obtained during the 2004 NEAQS-ITCT2k4 field campaign.

The approach is demonstrated to be a useful and computationally efficient alternative to pattern scaling and captures the nonlinear evolution of spatial patterns of climate anomalies inherent in transient climates. The approach does as well as pattern scaling in all circumstances and substantially better in many; it is not computationally demanding; and, once the statistical model is fit, it produces emulated climate output effectively instantaneously. It may therefore find wide application in climate impacts assessments and other policy analyses requiring rapid climate projections.},

But in the full period since the industrial revolution began, global warming is only about half of that expected due to the principal forcing, increasing greenhouse gases. The direct radiative effect of anthropogenic aerosols contributes only little towards resolving this discrepancy. Unforced climate variability is an unlikely explanation. We argue on the basis of several lines of indirect evidence that aerosol effects on clouds have caused a large negative forcing, at least −1 Wm −2 , which has substantially offset greenhouse warming. The tasks of observing this forcing and determining the microphysical mechanisms at its basis are exceptionally difficult, but they are essential for the prognosis of future climate change.},

Given updraft velocity (w), ε increases with increasing aerosol number concentration (Na) in the aerosol‐limited regime, peaks in the transitional regime, and decreases with further increasing Na in the updraft‐limited regime. This new finding further reconciles contrasting observations in literature and reinforces the compensating role of dispersion effect. The nonmonotonic behavior of ε further quantifies the relationship between the transitional Na and w that separates the aerosol‐ and updraft‐limited regimes.

It also regulates the rate of global temperature rise in response to rising GHGs4. The tropical Pacific Ocean response to rising GHGs impacts all of the world’s population. State-of-the-art climate models predict that rising GHGs reduce the west-to-east warm-to-cool sea surface temperature gradient across the equatorial Pacific5. In nature, however, the gradient has strengthened in recent decades as GHG concentrations have risen sharply5. This stark discrepancy between models and observations has troubled the climate research community for two decades. Here, by returning to the fundamental dynamics and thermodynamics of the tropical ocean–atmosphere system, and avoiding sources of model bias, we show that a parsimonious formulation of tropical Pacific dynamics yields a response that is consistent with observations and attributable to rising GHGs. We use the same dynamics to show that the erroneous warming in state-of-the-art models is a consequence of the cold bias of their equatorial cold tongues. The failure of state-of-the-art models to capture the correct response introduces critical error into their projections of climate change in the many regions sensitive to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures. Observations of the tropical Pacific exhibit an increasing zonal sea surface temperature gradient, while climate models predict the opposite. This study shows that an increased gradient is consistent with greenhouse gas warming, and that climate model discrepancies arise from cold tongue biases.},

It occurs at a variety of timescales, from the near-instantaneous Twomey effect, to the longer timescales required for cloud adjustments. Understanding the temporal evolution of cloud properties following an aerosol perturbation is necessary to interpret the results of so-called "natural experiments" from a known aerosol source, such as a ship or industrial site. This work uses reanalysis windfields and ship emission information matched to observations of shiptracks to measure the timescales of cloud responses to aerosol in instantaneous (or "snapshot") images taken by polar-orbiting satellites. As found in previous studies, the local meteorological environment is shown to have a strong impact on the occurrence and properties of shiptracks, but there is a strong time dependence in their properties. The largest droplet number concentration (Nd) responses are found within three hours of emission, while cloud adjustments continue to evolve over periods of ten hours or more. Cloud fraction is increased within the early life of shiptracks, with the formation of shiptracks in otherwise clear skies indicating that around 5–10 \% of clear-sky cases in this region may be aerosol-limited. The liquid water path (LWP) enhancement and the Nd-LWP sensitivity are also time dependent and strong functions of the background cloud and meteorological state. The near-instant response of the LWP within shiptracks may be evidence of a retrieval bias in previous estimates of the LWP response to aerosol derived from natural experiments. These results highlight the importance of temporal development and the background cloud field for quantifying the aerosol impact on clouds, even in situations where the aerosol perturbation is clear.},

The effects of aerosol pollution on clouds and solar and thermal radiation can be expected to alter regional climate and impact human health and food security. The climate of West Africa is characterized by a sensitive monsoon system that is associated with marked natural precipitation variability. This region has been and is projected to be subject to substantial global and regional-scale changes including greenhouse-gas-induced warming and sea-level rise, land-use and land-cover change, and substantial biomass burning. We argue that more attention should be paid to rapidly increasing air pollution over the explosively growing cities of West Africa, as experiences from other regions suggest that this can alter regional climate through the influences of aerosols on clouds and radiation, and will also affect human health and food security. We need better observations and models to quantify the magnitude and characteristics of these impacts.},

Monitoring the contributions of human-induced climate forcings to warming so far is key to understanding progress towards these goals. Here we use climate model simulations from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project, as well as regularized optimal fingerprinting, to show that anthropogenic forcings caused 0.9 to 1.3 °C of warming in global mean near-surface air temperature in 2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900, compared with an observed warming of 1.1 °C. Greenhouse gases and aerosols contributed changes of 1.2 to 1.9 °C and −0.7 to −0.1 °C, respectively, and natural forcings contributed negligibly. These results demonstrate the substantial human influence on climate so far and the urgency of action needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Quantifying the temperature impacts of anthropogenic emissions helps monitor proximity to the Paris Agreement goals. Human activities warmed global mean temperature during the past decade by 0.9 to 1.3 °C above 1850–1900 values, with 1.2 to 1.9 °C from greenhouse gases and −0.7 to −0.1 °C from aerosols.},

	abstract = {Aerosol–cloud radiative effects are determined and quantified in simulations of deep open-cell stratocumuli observed during the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) campaign off the west coast of Chile. The cloud deck forms in a boundary layer 1.5 km deep, with cell sizes reaching 50 km in diameter. Global databases of ship tracks suggest that these linear structures are seldom found in boundary layers this deep. Here, we quantify the changes in cloud radiative properties to a continuous aerosol point source moving along a fixed emission line releasing 1017 particles per second. We show that a spatially coherent cloud perturbation is not evident along the emission line. Yet our model simulates an increase in domain-mean all-sky albedo of 0.05, corresponding to a diurnally averaged cloud radiative effect of 20 Wm-2, given the annual mean solar insolation at the VOCALS-REx site. Therefore, marked changes in cloud radiative properties in precipitating deep open cells may be driven by anthropogenic near-surface aerosol perturbations, such as those generated by ships. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these changes in cloud radiative properties are masked by the naturally occurring variability within the organised cloud field. A clear detection and attribution of cloud radiative effects to a perturbation in aerosol concentrations becomes possible when sub-filtering of the cloud field is applied, using the spatio-temporal distribution of the aerosol perturbation. Therefore, this work has implications for the detection and attribution of effective cloud radiative forcing in marine stratocumuli, which constitutes one of the major physical uncertainties within the climate system. Our results suggest that ships may sometimes have a substantial radiative effect on marine clouds and albedo, even when ship tracks are not readily visible.},

	abstract = {New methodologies are required to probe the sensitivity of parameters describing cloud droplet activation. This paper presents an inverse modeling-based method for exploring cloud-aerosol interactions via response surfaces. The objective function, containing the difference between the measured and model predicted cloud droplet size distribution is studied in a two-dimensional framework, and presented for pseudo-adiabatic cloud parcel model parameters that are pair-wise selected. From this response surface analysis it is shown that the susceptibility of cloud droplet size distribution to variations in different aerosol physiochemical parameters is highly dependent on the aerosol environment and meteorological conditions. In general the cloud droplet size distribution is most susceptible to changes in the updraft velocity. A shift towards an increase in the importance of chemistry for the cloud nucleating ability of particles is shown to exist somewhere between marine average and rural continental aerosol regimes. We also use these response surfaces to explore the feasibility of inverse modeling to determine cloud-aerosol interactions. It is shown that the "cloud-aerosol" inverse problem is particularly difficult to solve due to significant parameter interaction, presence of multiple regions of attraction, numerous local optima, and considerable parameter insensitivity. The identifiability of the model parameters will be dependent on the choice of the objective function. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the location of the information content within the calibration data to confirm that our choice of objective function maximizes information retrieval from the cloud droplet size distribution. Cloud parcel models that employ a moving-centre based calculation of the cloud droplet size distribution pose additional difficulties when applying automatic search algorithms for studying cloud-aerosol interactions. To aid future studies, an increased resolution of the region of the size spectrum associated with droplet activation within cloud parcel models, or further development of fixed-sectional cloud models would be beneficial. Despite these improvements, it is demonstrated that powerful search algorithms remain necessary to efficiently explore the parameter space and successfully solve the cloud-aerosol inverse problem.},

The concentration Nd of droplets in clouds that influences planetary albedo is sensitive to the availability of aerosol particles on which the droplets form. Natural aerosol concentrations affect not only cloud properties themselves but also modulate the sensitivity of clouds to changes in anthropogenic aerosols. It is shown that modeled natural aerosols, principally marine biogenic primary and secondary aerosol sources, explain more than half of the spatiotemporal variability in satellite-observed Nd. Enhanced Nd is spatially correlated with regions of high chlorophyll a, and the spatiotemporal variability in Nd is found to be driven primarily by high concentrations of sulfate aerosol at lower Southern Ocean latitudes (35o to 45oS) and by organic matter in sea spray aerosol at higher latitudes (45o to 55oS). Biogenic sources are estimated to increase the summertime mean reflected solar radiation in excess of 10 W m–2 over parts of the Southern Ocean, which is comparable to the annual mean increases expected from anthropogenic aerosols over heavily polluted regions of the Northern Hemisphere.},

Our analysis employs a fully coupled numerical flow model to simulate the water vapor supersaturation, temperature, velocity profiles and CCN growth in the CFSTGC for its entire range of operation (aerosol sample flow rates 0.25–2.0 L min − 1 , temperature differences 2–15 K and ambient pressures 100–1000 mb).

The model was used to evaluate the CCN detection efficiency for a wide range of ambient pressures, flow rates, temperature gradients, and droplet growth kinetics. Simulations overestimate the instrument supersaturation when the thermal resistance across the walls of the flow chamber is not considered.

Representing Sc and their radiative impact is one of the largest challenges for global climate models. Sc fields self-organize into cellular patterns and thus lend themselves to analysis and quantification in terms of natural cellular networks. Based on large-eddy simulations of Sc fields, we present a first analysis of the geometric structure and self-organization of Sc patterns from this network perspective. Our network analysis shows that the Sc pattern is scale-invariant as a consequence of entropy maximization that is known as Lewis’s Law (scaling parameter: 0.16) and is largely independent of the Sc regime (cloud-free vs. cloudy cell centers). Cells are, on average, hexagonal with a neighbor number variance of about 2, and larger cells tend to be surrounded by smaller cells, as described by an Aboav–Weaire parameter of 0.9. The network structure is neither completely random nor characteristic of natural convection. Instead, it emerges from Sc-specific versions of cell division and cell merging that are shaped by cell expansion. This is shown with a heuristic model of network dynamics that incorporates our physical understanding of cloud processes.},

Results over 12 subcontinental regions show that five models improved, whereas three degraded in reproducing the interregional variability in Zα0–6 km, the mean extinction height diagnostic, as computed from the CALIOP aerosol profiles over the 0–6 km altitude range for each studied region and season. While the models' performance remains highly variable, the simulation of the timing of the Zα0–6 km peak season has also improved for all but two models from AeroCom Phase I to Phase II. The biases in Zα0–6 km are smaller in all regions except Central Atlantic, East Asia, and North and South Africa. Most of the models now underestimate Zα0–6 km over land, notably in the dust and biomass burning regions in Asia and Africa. At global scale, the AeroCom II models better reproduce the Zα0–6 km latitudinal variability over ocean than over land.

Algorithm development is focused on improving aerosol retrievals by means of including a detailed statistical optimization of the influence of noise in the inversion procedure. The methodological aspects of such an optimization are discussed in detail and revised according to both modern findings in inversion theory and practical experience in remote sensing. Accordingly, the proposed inversion algorithm is built on the principles of statistical estimation: the spectral radiances and various a priori constraints on aerosol characteristics are considered as multisource data that are known with predetermined accuracy. The inversion is designed as a search for the best fit of all input data by a theoretical model that takes into account the different levels of accuracy of the fitted data. The algorithm allows a choice of normal or lognormal noise assumptions. The multivariable fitting is implemented by a stable numerical procedure combining matrix inversion and univariant relaxation. The theoretical inversion scheme has been realized in the advanced algorithm retrieving aerosol size distribution together with complex refractive index from the spectral measurements of direct and diffuse radiation. The aerosol particles are modeled as homogeneous spheres. The atmospheric radiative transfer modeling is implemented with well‐established publicly available radiative transfer codes. The retrieved refractive indices can be wavelength dependent; however, the extended smoothness constraints are applied to its spectral dependence (and indirectly through smoothness constraints on retrieved size distributions). The positive effects of statistical optimization on the retrieval results as well as the importance of applying a priori constraints are discussed in detail for the retrieval of both aerosol size distribution and complex refractive index. The developed algorithm is adapted for the retrieval of aerosol properties from measurements made by ground‐based Sun‐sky scanning radiometers used in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The results of numerical tests together with examples of experimental data inversions are presented.},

Processes such as drizzle and entrainment can lead to subadiabatic LWPmeasured. This study examines α and its relationship to microphysical properties for 86 cloud events over the Northeast Pacific Ocean based on data collected during four separate summertime airborne campaigns. For the study region, α was found to be 0.766 ± 0.134. For most cases, clouds with a low value of α were found to have lower droplet number concentration (Nd), higher droplet effective radius (re), higher relative dispersion (d), and higher rain rate (R). The subcloud aerosol concentration (Na) was often less for the low‐α cases. The relationship between α and the vertical profiles and cloud‐top characteristics for both the cloud droplet‐only spectrum and full spectrum (cloud and rain droplets) is also examined. Inclusion of rain droplets produced a larger change in d for the low‐α clouds as compared to the high‐α clouds. On average, R increased at cloud top for high‐α clouds but decreased at cloud top for low‐α clouds. Accounting for α when estimating Nd from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer retrievals results in better agreement with in situ Nd values. Results of this work motivate the need for additional focus on the factors governing α, such as cloud type, and implications of its value, especially for remote‐sensing retrievals. Average cloud adiabaticity (α) over the Northeast Pacific Ocean was found to be 0.766 ± 0.134 based on airborne analysis of 86 cloud events Cloud droplet number concentration, droplet effective radius, relative dispersion, and rain rate are correlated with α Inclusion of α in calculations from satellite remote‐sensing retrievals results in greater agreement with in situ values},

VIIRS also has an imager with five channels of double resolution of 375 m, which was not designed for retrieving cloud products. A methodology for a high-resolution retrieval of re and microphysical presentation of the cloud field based on the VIIRS imager was developed and evaluated with respect to MODIS in this study. The tripled microphysical resolution with respect to MODIS allows obtaining new insights for cloud–aerosol interactions, especially at the smallest cloud scales, because the VIIRS imager can resolve the small convective elements that are sub-pixel for MODIS cloud products. Examples are given for new insights into ship tracks in marine stratocumulus, pollution tracks from point and diffused sources in stratocumulus and cumulus clouds over land, deep tropical convection in pristine air mass over ocean and land, tropical clouds that develop in smoke from forest fires and in heavy pollution haze over densely populated regions in southeastern Asia, and for pyro-cumulonimbus clouds.  It is found that the VIIRS imager provides more robust physical interpretation and refined information for cloud and aerosol microphysics as compared to MODIS, especially in the initial stage of cloud formation. VIIRS is found to identify significantly more fully cloudy pixels when small boundary layer convective elements are present. This, in turn, allows for a better quantification of cloud–aerosol interactions and impacts on precipitation-forming processes.},

By running a state-of-the-art climate model thousands of times, it is possible to find out how the model responds to slight changes in the approximations of physical processes that cannot be calculated explicitly. The first batch of results has now been analysed, and surface temperature changes in simulations that capture the climate realistically are ranging from below 2 °C to more than 11 °C. These represent the possible long-term change, averaged over the whole planet, as a result of doubling the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the model. This is the first time that complex models have been found with such a wide range of responses. Their existence will help in quantifying the risks associated with climate change on a regional level. The range of possibilities for future climate evolution1,2,3 needs to be taken into account when planning climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. This requires ensembles of multi-decadal simulations to assess both chaotic climate variability and model response uncertainty4,5,6,7,8,9. Statistical estimates of model response uncertainty, based on observations of recent climate change10,11,12,13, admit climate sensitivities—defined as the equilibrium response of global mean temperature to doubling levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide—substantially greater than 5 K. But such strong responses are not used in ranges for future climate change14 because they have not been seen in general circulation models. Here we present results from the ‘climateprediction.net’ experiment, the first multi-thousand-member grand ensemble of simulations using a general circulation model and thereby explicitly resolving regional details15,16,17,18,19,20,21. We find model versions as realistic as other state-of-the-art climate models but with climate sensitivities ranging from less than 2 K to more than 11 K. Models with such extreme sensitivities are critical for the study of the full range of possible responses of the climate system to rising greenhouse gas levels, and for assessing the risks associated with specific targets for stabilizing these levels.},

By comparing model simulations that only consider changes in greenhouse gas forcing (GHG) with simulations that also consider the time evolution of anthropogenic aerosol emissions (GHGAERO), the influence of aerosol forcing on modeled surface temperature trends, and the dependence of the forcing on the model representation of aerosols and aerosol indirect effects, was evaluated. One group of models include sophisticated parameterizations of aerosol activation into cloud droplets; viz., the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is a function of the modeled supersaturation as well as the aerosol concentration. In these models, the temperature trend bias was reduced in GHGAERO compared to GHG in more regions than in the other models. The ratio between high- and low-latitude warming also improved compared to observations. In a second group of models, the CDNC is diagnosed using an empirical relationship between the CDNC and the aerosol concentration. In this group, the temperature trend bias was reduced in more regions than in the model group where no aerosol indirect effects are considered. No clear difference could be found between models that include an explicit aerosol module and the ones that utilize prescribed aerosol. There was also no clear difference between models that include aerosol effects on the precipitation formation rate and the ones that do not. The results indicate that the best representation of recent observed surface temperature trends is obtained if the modeled CDNC is a function of both the aerosol concentration and the supersaturation.},

Despite the number of numerical cloud-aerosol sensitivity studies previously conducted few have used statistical analysis tools to investigate the global sensitivity of a cloud model to input aerosol physiochemical parameters. Using numerically generated cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) distributions (i.e. synthetic data) as cloud observations, this inverse modelling framework is shown to successfully estimate the correct calibration parameters, and their underlying posterior probability distribution. The employed analysis method provides a new, integrative framework to evaluate the global sensitivity of the derived CDNC distribution to the input parameters describing the lognormal properties of the accumulation mode aerosol and the particle chemistry. To a large extent, results from prior studies are confirmed, but the present study also provides some additional insights. There is a transition in relative sensitivity from very clean marine Arctic conditions where the lognormal aerosol parameters representing the accumulation mode aerosol number concentration and mean radius and are found to be most important for determining the CDNC distribution to very polluted continental environments (aerosol concentration in the accumulation mode {\textgreater}1000 cm−3) where particle chemistry is more important than both number concentration and size of the accumulation mode. The competition and compensation between the cloud model input parameters illustrates that if the soluble mass fraction is reduced, the aerosol number concentration, geometric standard deviation and mean radius of the accumulation mode must increase in order to achieve the same CDNC distribution. This study demonstrates that inverse modelling provides a flexible, transparent and integrative method for efficiently exploring cloud-aerosol interactions with respect to parameter sensitivity and correlation.},

Rapid reductions in anthropogenic aerosol and precursor emissions between the present day and the 2050s lead to enhanced increases in global and Asian summer monsoon precipitation relative to scenarios with weak air quality policies. However, the effects of aerosol reductions do not persist to the end of the 21st century for precipitation, when instead the response to greenhouse gases dominates differences across the SSPs.

Precipitation increases here are initially suppressed in SSPs 2-4.5, 3-7.0, and 5-8.5 relative to SSP1-1.9 when the impact of remote emission decreases is counteracted by continued increases in South Asian emissions.},

	abstract = {Emulators, or reduced complexity climate models, are surrogate Earth system models (ESMs) that produce projections of key climate quantities with minimal computational resources. Using time‐series modeling or more advanced machine learning techniques, data‐driven emulators have emerged as a promising avenue of research, producing spatially resolved climate responses that are visually indistinguishable from state‐of‐the‐art ESMs. Yet, their lack of physical interpretability limits their wider adoption. In this work, we introduce FaIRGP, a data‐driven emulator that satisfies the physical temperature response equations of an energy balance model. The result is an emulator that (a) enjoys the flexibility of statistical machine learning models and can learn from data, and (b) has a robust physical grounding with interpretable parameters that can be used to make inference about the climate system. Further, our Bayesian approach allows a principled and mathematically tractable uncertainty quantification. Our model demonstrates skillful emulation of global mean surface temperature and spatial surface temperatures across realistic future scenarios. Its ability to learn from data allows it to outperform EBMs, while its robust physical foundation safeguards against the pitfalls of purely data‐driven models. We also illustrate how FaIRGP can be used to obtain estimates of top‐of‐atmosphere radiative forcing and discuss the benefits of its mathematical tractability for applications such as detection and attribution or precipitation emulation. We hope that this work will contribute to widening the adoption of data‐driven methods in climate emulation. Emulators are simplified climate models that can be used to rapidly explore climate scenarios—they can run in less than a minute on an average computer. They are key tools used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to explore the diversity of possible future climates. Data‐driven emulators use advanced machine learning techniques to produce climate predictions that look very similar to the predictions of complex climate models. However, they are not easy to interpret, and therefore to trust in practice. In this work, we introduce FaIRGP, a data‐driven emulator based on physics. The emulator is flexible and can learn from data to improve its predictions, but is also grounded on physical energy balance relationships, which makes it robust and interpretable. The model performs well in predicting future global and local temperatures under realistic future scenarios, outperforming purely physics‐driven or purely data‐driven models. Further, the probabilistic nature of our model allows for mathematically tractable uncertainty quantification. By gaining trust in such a data‐driven yet physically grounded model, we hope the climate science community can benefit more widely from their potential. We introduce FaIRGP, a Bayesian machine learning emulator for global and local mean surface temperatures that builds upon a physically based simple climate model The model improves upon both purely physically‐driven and purely data‐driven baseline emulators on several metrics across realistic future scenarios The model is fully mathematically tractable, which makes it a convenient and easy‐to‐use probabilistic tool for the emulation of surface temperatures, but also for downstream applications such as detection and attribution or precipitation emulation We introduce FaIRGP, a Bayesian machine learning emulator for global and local mean surface temperatures that builds upon a physically based simple climate model The model improves upon both purely physically‐driven and purely data‐driven baseline emulators on several metrics across realistic future scenarios The model is fully mathematically tractable, which makes it a convenient and easy‐to‐use probabilistic tool for the emulation of surface temperatures, but also for downstream applications such as detection and attribution or precipitation emulation},

Models are usually tuned to achieve good agreement with observations, but tuning produces just one of many potential variants of a model, so the model uncertainty cannot be determined. Here we estimate the uncertainty in aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) in a tuned climate model by constraining 4 million variants of the HadGEM3-UKCA aerosol–climate model to match nine common observations (top-of-atmosphere shortwave flux, aerosol optical depth, PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$, cloud condensation nuclei at 0.2{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% supersaturation (CCN$_{\textrm{0.2}}$), and concentrations of sulfate, black carbon and organic carbon, as well as decadal trends in aerosol optical depth and surface shortwave radiation.) The model uncertainty is calculated by using a perturbed parameter ensemble that samples 27 uncertainties in both the aerosol model and the physical climate model, and we use synthetic observations generated from the model itself to determine the potential of each observational type to constrain this uncertainty. Focusing over Europe in July, we show that the aerosol ERF uncertainty can be reduced by about 30{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% by constraining it to the nine observations, demonstrating that producing climate models with an observationally plausible {\textless}q{\textgreater}base state{\textless}/q{\textgreater} can contribute to narrowing the uncertainty in aerosol ERF. However, the uncertainty in the aerosol ERF after observational constraint is large compared to the typical spread of a multi-model ensemble. Our results therefore raise questions about whether the underlying multi-model uncertainty would be larger if similar approaches as adopted here were applied more widely. The approach presented in this study could be used to identify the most effective observations for model constraint. It is hoped that aerosol ERF uncertainty can be further reduced by introducing process-related constraints; however, any such results will be robust only if the enormous number of potential model variants is explored.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The field experiment gathered detailed information on the chemical composition of the inflow and outflow regions of midlatitude thunderstorms in northeast Colorado, west Texas to central Oklahoma, and northern Alabama. A unique aspect of the DC3 strategy was to locate and sample the convective outflow a day after active convection in order to measure the chemical transformations within the upper-tropospheric convective plume. These data are being analyzed to investigate transport and dynamics of the storms, scavenging of soluble trace gases and aerosols, production of nitrogen oxides by lightning, relationships between lightning flash rates and storm parameters, chemistry in the upper troposphere that is affected by the convection, and related source characterization of the three sampling regions. DC3 also documented biomass-burning plumes and the interactions of these plumes with deep convection.},

Several different approaches exist and have partly already been successfully applied in climate science. However, the often missing ground truth explanations complicate their evaluation and validation, subsequently compounding the choice of the XAI method. Therefore, in this work, we introduce XAI evaluation in the context of climate research and assess different desired explanation properties, namely, robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization. To this end we build upon previous work and train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the decade based on annual-mean temperature maps. Next, multiple local XAI methods are applied and their performance is quantified for each evaluation property and compared against a baseline test. Independent of the network type, we find that the XAI methods Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise relevance propagation, and InputGradients exhibit considerable robustness, faithfulness, and complexity while sacrificing randomization. The opposite is true for Gradient, SmoothGrad, NoiseGrad, and FusionGrad. Notably, explanations using input perturbations, such as SmoothGrad and Integrated Gradients, do not improve robustness and faithfulness, contrary to previous claims. Overall, our experiments offer a comprehensive overview of different properties of explanation methods in the climate science context and supports users in the selection of a suitable XAI method.},

The tool is being developed in such a way that additional analyses can easily be added. A set of standard namelists for each scientific topic reproduces specific sets of diagnostics or performance metrics that have demonstrated their importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed literature. The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is a community effort open to both users and developers encouraging open exchange of diagnostic source code and evaluation results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) ensemble. This will facilitate and improve ESM evaluation beyond the state-of-the-art and aims at supporting such activities within CMIP and at individual modelling centres. Ultimately, we envisage running the ESMValTool alongside the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) as part of a more routine evaluation of CMIP model simulations while utilizing observations available in standard formats (obs4MIPs) or provided by the user.},

	abstract = {The response of upper tropospheric clouds and relative humidity (RH) to warming is important to the overall sensitivity of the Earth to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Previous research has shown that changes in hydrologic fields should closely track rising isotherms in a warming climate. Here we show that the distribution of tropical clouds and RH in general circulation models is approximately constant under greenhouse warming when using temperature as a vertical coordinate. By assuming that these fields are an invariant function of atmospheric temperature and that temperature change follows a dilute moist adiabat, we are able to accurately predict cloud fraction and RH changes in the tropical upper troposphere (150–400 hPa) in 27 general circulation models. Our results indicate that intermodel spread in changes of tropical upper tropospheric clouds and RH is closely related to differences in model climatology and could be substantially reduced if model ensembles reliably reproduced observed climatologies. As the Earth warms due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, many aspects of the climate adjust. Clouds, for example, tend to shift upward in response to surface warming. Such processes, known as climate feedbacks, alter the radiative energy that reaches the Earth's surface and, as a result, can amplify or damp global warming. One method for investigating climate feedbacks is to analyze their behavior in global climate models. Because clouds and relative humidity exhibit widely varying responses to warming in climate models, uncertainty in the Earth's sensitivity to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide is exacerbated. Building on previous theoretical research, we demonstrate that the simulated response of clouds and relative humidity to global warming is closely associated with model representation of the present‐day climate. Theory, observations, and climate models indicate that moistening of the troposphere and rising of the highest cloud tops cause large positive feedbacks. Our research suggests that the substantial model spread in representing these feedbacks may be reduced by improving simulations of the observed present‐day climate. Tropical upper tropospheric clouds and relative humidity in climate models track isotherms, which rise in response to greenhouse warming Intermodel differences in cloud and relative humidity changes are related to model climatology, which shifts up with CO2‐mediated warming Observations provide a constraint on simulated changes in tropical upper tropospheric clouds and relative humidity},

Since the number concentrations of all these hydrometeors are calculated explicitly, all relevant homogenous and heterogenous nucleation processes have been parameterized including the activation of cloud condensation nuclei, which is not predicted in most state-of-the-art cloud resolving models. Therefore the new scheme can discriminate between continental and maritime conditions and can be used for investigations of aerosol effects on the precipitation formation in mixed-phase clouds. In addition, the scheme includes turbulence effects on droplet coalescence, collisional breakup of raindrops and size-dependent collision efficiencies.

	abstract = {ICON‐A is the new icosahedral nonhydrostatic (ICON) atmospheric general circulation model in a configuration using the Max Planck Institute physics package, which originates from the ECHAM6 general circulation model, and has been adapted to account for the changed dynamical core framework. The coupling scheme between dynamics and physics employs a sequential updating by dynamics and physics, and a fixed sequence of the physical processes similar to ECHAM6. To allow a meaningful initial comparison between ICON‐A and the established ECHAM6‐LR model, a setup with similar, low resolution in terms of number of grid points and levels is chosen. The ICON‐A model is tuned on the base of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) experiment aiming primarily at a well balanced top‐of atmosphere energy budget to make the model suitable for coupled climate and Earth system modeling. The tuning addresses first the moisture and cloud distribution to achieve the top‐of‐atmosphere energy balance, followed by the tuning of the parameterized dynamic drag aiming at reduced wind errors in the troposphere. The resulting version of ICON‐A has overall biases, which are comparable to those of ECHAM6. Problematic specific biases remain in the vertical distribution of clouds and in the stratospheric circulation, where the winter vortices are too weak. Biases in precipitable water and tropospheric temperature are, however, reduced compared to the ECHAM6. ICON‐A will serve as the basis of further development and as the atmosphere component to the coupled model, ICON‐Earth system model (ESM). ICON‐A is a new atmospheric model as needed for research on the general circulation of the atmosphere, or as atmospheric component in an Earth system model, as used in climate research. This article describes the construction of the atmospheric model, in particular how two major parts are coupled to each other: “dynamics” and “physics.” Dynamics is the part that solves the equations for the atmospheric motion, temperature, density, and concentrations of water vapor, cloud water, and cloud ice. Physics is the part that computes the changes in these fields related to processes like radiation, cloud condensation, or turbulence. These physical changes depend on the state of the atmosphere as computed by the dynamics, and the changes computed by physics force change in the dynamics. The article documents the details of this construction. Further, the article describes how the physics is tuned to obtain a good representation of the general circulation of the period 1979 to 1988 in comparison to observations. A more detailed evaluation of such simulations is presented in a companion article by Crueger et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017MS001233).

	abstract = {The usefulness of previous Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) exercises has been hampered by a lack of radiative forcing information. This has made it difficult to understand reasons for differences between model responses. Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is easier to diagnose than traditional radiative forcing in global climate models (GCMs) and is more representative of the eventual temperature response. Here we examine the different methods of computing ERF in two GCMs. We find that ERF computed from a fixed sea surface temperature (SST) method (ERF\_fSST) has much more certainty than regression based methods. Thirty year integrations are sufficient to reduce the 5–95\% confidence interval in global ERF\_fSST to 0.1 W m−2. For 2xCO2 ERF, 30 year integrations are needed to ensure that the signal is larger than the local confidence interval over more than 90\% of the globe. Within the ERF\_fSST method there are various options for prescribing SSTs and sea ice. We explore these and find that ERF is only weakly dependent on the methodological choices. Prescribing the monthly averaged seasonally varying model's preindustrial climatology is recommended for its smaller random error and easier implementation. As part of CMIP6, the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) asks models to conduct 30 year ERF\_fSST experiments using the model's own preindustrial climatology of SST and sea ice. The Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) will also mainly use this approach. We propose this as a standard method for diagnosing ERF and recommend that it be used across the climate modeling community to aid future comparisons. We recommend a protocol for estimating ERF in GCMs Error characteristics of ERF make diagnosing small forcings hard Some CMIP6 protocols may not work (AerCHemMIP in particular)},

The vegetation field may be emulated directly from the orbital variables, but an appealing alternative is to relate it to emulations of the climate fields, which involves high-dimensional input and output. The SVDs radically reduce the dimensionality of the input and output spaces and are shown to clarify the relationships between them.

We focus particularly on an evaluation of aerosol types, using the CALIOP vertical feature mask (VFM) algorithm, and look especially at Saharan dust distributions during July 2009. MERRAero consists of an aerosol simulation produced in the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) Earth system model and incorporates assimilation of MODIS-derived aerosol optical thickness (AOT) to constrain column aerosol loadings. For comparison to the CALIOP VFM we construct two synthetic VFMs using the MERRAero aerosol distributions: a CALIOP-like VFM in which we simulate the total attenuated backscatter and particle depolarization ratio from the MERRAero output and pass those into the CALIOP VFM typing algorithm (MERRAero-CALIOP), and an extinction-based VFM in which we use the MERRAero-simulated species-resolved extinction to map the MERRAero species to the CALIOP VFM types (MERRAero-Extinction). By comparing the MERRAero-CALIOP VFM to CALIOP VFM, we can diagnose the aerosol transport and speciation in MERRAero. By comparing the MERRAero-CALIOP and MERRAero-Extinction-simulated VFM, we perform a simple observing system experiment (OSE), which is useful for identifying limitations of the CALIOP VFM algorithm itself. We find that, despite having our column AOT constrained by MODIS, comparison to the CALIOP VFM reveals a greater occurrence of dusty aerosol layers in our MERRAero-CALIOP VFM due to errors in MERRAero aerosol speciation. Additionally, we find that the CALIOP VFM algorithm is challenged when classifying aerosol features when multiple aerosol types are present, as our application of the CALIOP VFM algorithm to MERRAero aerosol distributions classified marine-dominated aerosol layers with low aerosol loadings as polluted dust when the contribution of dust to the total extinction was low.},

	abstract = {Clouds' susceptibility to aerosols is considered to be a leading source of uncertainty in climate research. An inability to account simultaneously for the large range of scales involved in cloud‐aerosol‐climate interactions has hindered the progress of research. In this study, using a novel system of idealized large‐eddy‐simulations that explicitly resolves clouds but also accounts, in an idealized manner, for large‐scale changes in the thermodynamic and dynamic conditions and for inter‐cloud regime coupling, it is shown that aerosol perturbation in the sub‐tropics increases cloudiness in the tropics. Specifically, aerosol‐driven sub‐tropical rain suppression leads to increased advection of cold and moist air from the sub‐tropics to the tropics, thus enhancing tropical cloudiness. The increased tropical cloudiness has a strong cooling effect by reflecting more of the incoming solar radiation. The classical “aerosol‐cloud lifetime effect” is shown here to have a small local effect (in the sub‐tropics) but a strong remote effect (sub‐tropical aerosols increase cloudiness in the tropics), thus widening the concept of cloud adjustments to aerosol perturbation. Challenges in understanding the link between clouds, aerosols and the atmospheric circulation hindered the progress in climate‐change research. In the tropics, different cloud regimes are formed at slightly different locations and the different regimes are connected by the tropical circulation. Thus, aerosol (which serve as cloud condensation nuclei) effects on one cloud regime may also affect the properties of different regimes. In this paper a novel setup of idealized simulations is developed to study the interactions between different cloud regimes and the aerosol effect on them. Based on these idealized simulations we demonstrate that by suppressing rain in the sub‐tropics, aerosols could enhance tropical cloudiness. The enhanced tropical cloudiness results in a net local cooling effect due to a larger shortwave reflection at the top of the atmosphere. These results suggest that aerosol‐cloud‐interactions should be examined under broad spatial‐temporal scales to account for the fact that aerosol perturbation in one location could affect the cloud properties in different, remote locations due to variations in the large‐scale circulation.

Because aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei can have a strong influence on the cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), previous studies have used the sensitivity of the Nd to aerosol properties as a constraint on the strength of the RFaci. However, recent studies have suggested that relationships between aerosol and cloud properties in the present-day climate may not be suitable for determining the sensitivity of the Nd to anthropogenic aerosol perturbations. Using an ensemble of global aerosol–climate models, this study demonstrates how joint histograms between Nd and aerosol properties can account for many of the issues raised by previous studies. It shows that if the anthropogenic contribution to the aerosol is known, the RFaci can be diagnosed to within 20\% of its actual value. The accuracy of different aerosol proxies for diagnosing the RFaci is investigated, confirming that using the aerosol optical depth significantly underestimates the strength of the aerosol–cloud interactions in satellite data.},

	abstract = {The cooling of the Earth’s climate through the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds offsets an unknown fraction of greenhouse gas warming. An increase in the amount of water inside liquid-phase clouds induced by aerosols, through the suppression of rain formation, has been postulated to lead to substantial cooling, which would imply that the Earth’s surface temperature is highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Here we provide direct observational evidence that, instead of a strong increase, aerosols cause a relatively weak average decrease in the amount of water in liquid-phase clouds compared with unpolluted clouds. Measurements of polluted clouds downwind of various anthropogenic sources—such as oil refineries, smelters, coal-fired power plants, cities, wildfires and ships—reveal that aerosol-induced cloud-water increases, caused by suppressed rain formation, and decreases, caused by enhanced evaporation of cloud water, partially cancel each other out. We estimate that the observed decrease in cloud water offsets 23\% of the global climate-cooling effect caused by aerosol-induced increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. These findings invalidate the hypothesis that increases in cloud water cause a substantial climate cooling effect and translate into reduced uncertainty in projections of future climate. Satellite data for cloud tracks downwind of major pollution sources show a relatively small global average decrease in cloud water caused by anthropogenic aerosols, invalidating claims that aerosol-induced effects contribute substantially to climate cooling.},

	abstract = {A new three-dimensional cloud resolving model (CRM) has been developed to study the statistical properties of cumulus convection. The model was applied to simulate a 28-day evolution of clouds over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains site during the summer 1997 Intensive Observation Period. The model was forced by the large-scale advective tendencies and surface fluxes derived from the observations. The sensitivity of the results to the domain dimensionality and size, horizontal grid resolution, and parameterization of microphysics has been tested. In addition, the sensitivity to perturbed initial conditions has also been tested using a 20-member ensemble of runs. The model captures rather well the observed temporal evolution of the precipitable water and precipitation rate, although it severely underestimates the shaded cloud fraction possibly because of an inability to account for the lateral advection of clouds over the ARM site. The ensemble runs reveal that the uncertainty of the simulated precipitable water due to the fundamental uncertainty of the initial conditions can be as large as 25\% of the mean values. Even though the precipitation rates averaged over the whole simulation period were virtually identical among the ensemble members, the timing uncertainty of the onset and reaching the precipitation maximum can be as long as one full day. Despite the predictability limitations, the mean simulation statistics are found to be almost insensitive to the uncertainty of the initial conditions. The overall effects of the third spatial dimension are found to be minor for simulated mean fields and scalar fluxes but are quite considerable for velocity and scalar variances. Neither changes in a rather wide range of the domain size nor the horizontal grid resolution have any significant impact on the simulations. Although a rather strong sensitivity of the mean hydrometeor profiles and, consequently, cloud fraction to the microphysics parameters is found, the effects on the predicted mean temperature and humidity profiles are shown to be modest. It is found that the spread among the time series of the simulated cloud fraction, precipitable water, and surface precipitation rate due to changes in the microphysics parameters is within the uncertainty of the ensemble runs. This suggests that correlation of the CRM simulations to the observed long time series of the aforementioned parameters cannot be generally used to validate the microphysics scheme.},

Multi-frame Super-Resolution (MFSR) offers a more grounded approach to the ill-posed problem, by conditioning on multiple low-resolution views. This is important for satellite monitoring of human impact on the planet -- from deforestation, to human rights violations -- that depend on reliable imagery. To this end, we present HighRes-net, the first deep learning approach to MFSR that learns its sub-tasks in an end-to-end fashion: (i) co-registration, (ii) fusion, (iii) up-sampling, and (iv) registration-at-the-loss. Co-registration of low-resolution views is learned implicitly through a reference-frame channel, with no explicit registration mechanism. We learn a global fusion operator that is applied recursively on an arbitrary number of low-resolution pairs. We introduce a registered loss, by learning to align the SR output to a ground-truth through ShiftNet. We show that by learning deep representations of multiple views, we can super-resolve low-resolution signals and enhance Earth Observation data at scale. Our approach recently topped the European Space Agency's MFSR competition on real-world satellite imagery.},

The particulates' interaction with radiation, which defines their climate effect, is strongly dependent on their optical properties. In the present work, we study one of the most important optical properties of aerosols, the asymmetry parameter (\textit{g}$_{\textrm{aer}}$), over sea surfaces of the region comprising North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin. These areas are of great interest, because of the variety of aerosol types they host, both anthropogenic and natural. Using satellite data from the collection 051 of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Terra and Aqua), we investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the asymmetry parameter. We generally find significant spatial variability, with larger values over regions dominated by larger size particles, e.g., outside the Atlantic coasts of northwestern Africa, where desert-dust outflow takes place. The \textit{g}$_{\textrm{aer}}$ values tend to decrease with increasing wavelength, especially over areas dominated by small particulates. The intra-annual variability is found to be small in desert-dust areas, with maximum values during summer, while in all other areas larger values are reported during the cold season and smaller during the warm. Significant intra-annual and inter-annual variability is observed around the Black Sea.

This way, we provide some insight on the quality and reliability of MODIS data.

However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities.

Additionally, the method provides a stricter statistical approach to pathways of atmospheric teleconnections, yielding insights into the Pacific–Indian Ocean interaction relevant for monsoonal dynamics.

In contrast, here we consider the broader question: given a (large-scale) model containing uncertain parameters, (possibly) noisy observational data, and a prediction quantity of interest, how do we construct efficient and scalable algorithms to (1) infer the model parameters from the data (the deterministic inverse problem), (2) quantify the uncertainty in the inferred parameters (the Bayesian inference problem), and (3) propagate the resulting uncertain parameters through the model to issue predictions with quantified uncertainties (the forward uncertainty propagation problem)?We present efficient and scalable algorithms for this end-to-end, data-to-prediction process under the Gaussian approximation and in the context of modeling the flow of the Antarctic ice sheet and its effect on loss of grounded ice to the ocean. The ice is modeled as a viscous, incompressible, creeping, shear-thinning fluid. The observational data come from satellite measurements of surface ice flow velocity, and the uncertain parameter field to be inferred is the basal sliding parameter, represented by a heterogeneous coefficient in a Robin boundary condition at the base of the ice sheet. The prediction quantity of interest is the present-day ice mass flux from the Antarctic continent to the ocean.We show that the work required for executing this data-to-prediction process—measured in number of forward (and adjoint) ice sheet model solves—is independent of the state dimension, parameter dimension, data dimension, and the number of processor cores. The key to achieving this dimension independence is to exploit the fact that, despite their large size, the observational data typically provide only sparse information on model parameters. This property can be exploited to construct a low rank approximation of the linearized parameter-to-observable map via randomized SVD methods and adjoint-based actions of Hessians of the data misfit functional.},

Here we show that regionally averaged time series of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observed CDNC of low, liquid-topped clouds is well predicted by the MERRA2 reanalysis near-surface sulfate mass concentration over decadal timescales. A multiple linear regression between MERRA2 reanalyses masses of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), sea salt (SS), and dust (DU) shows that CDNC across many different regimes can be reproduced by a simple power-law fit to near-surface SO4, with smaller contributions from BC, OC, SS, and DU. This confirms previous work using a less sophisticated retrieval of CDNC on monthly timescales. The analysis is supported by an examination of remotely sensed sulfur dioxide (SO2) over maritime volcanoes and the east coasts of North America and Asia, revealing that maritime CDNC responds to changes in SO2 as observed by the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI). This investigation of aerosol reanalysis and top-down remote-sensing observations reveals that emission controls in Asia and North America have decreased CDNC in their maritime outflow on a decadal timescale.},

To better represent droplet nucleation from a complex, multimodal, and multicomponent aerosol population within the context of a global model, a new metamodeling framework is applied to derive an efficient and accurate activation parameterization. The framework applies polynomial chaos expansion to a detailed parcel model in order to derive an emulator that maps thermodynamic and aerosol parameters to the supersaturation maximum achieved in an adiabatically ascending parcel and can be used to diagnose droplet number from a single lognormal aerosol mode. The emulator requires much less computational time to build, store, and evaluate than a high-dimensional lookup table. Compared to large sample sets from the detailed parcel model, the relative error in the predicted supersaturation maximum and activated droplet number computed with the best emulator is and (one standard deviation), respectively. On average, the emulators constructed here are as accurate and between 10 and 17 times faster than a leading physically based activation parameterization. Because the underlying parcel model being emulated resolves size-dependent droplet growth factors, the emulator captures kinetic limitations on activation. The results discussed in this work suggest that this metamodeling framework can be extended to accurately account for the detailed activation of a complex aerosol population in an arbitrary coupled global aerosol–climate model.},

	abstract = {A method is proposed for combining information from several emergent constraints into a probabilistic estimate for a climate sensitivity proxy Y such as equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The method is based on fitting a multivariate Gaussian PDF for Y and the emergent constraints using an ensemble of global climate models (GCMs); it can be viewed as a form of multiple linear regression of Y on the constraints. The method accounts for uncertainties in sampling this multidimensional PDF with a small number of models, for observational uncertainties in the constraints, and for overconfidence about the correlation of the constraints with the climate sensitivity. Its general form (Method C) accounts for correlations between the constraints. Method C becomes less robust when some constraints are too strongly related to each other; this can be mitigated using regularization approaches such as ridge regression. An illuminating special case, Method U, neglects any correlations between constraints except through their mutual relationship to the climate proxy; it is more robust to small GCM sample size and is appealingly interpretable. These methods are applied to ECS and the climate feedback parameter using a previously published set of 11 possible emergent constraints derived from climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The ±2σ posterior range of ECS for Method C with no overconfidence adjustment is 4.3 ± 0.7 K. For Method U with a large overconfidence adjustment, it is 4.0 ± 1.3 K. This study adds confidence to past findings that most constraints predict higher climate sensitivity than the CMIP mean.},

	abstract = {Cloud detection is a crucial step in the optical satellite image processing pipeline for Earth observation. Clouds in optical remote sensing images seriously affect the visibility of the background and greatly reduce the usability of images for land applications. Traditional methods based on thresholding, multi-temporal or multi-spectral information are often specific to a particular satellite sensor. Convolutional Neural Networks for cloud detection often require labeled cloud masks for training that are very time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid cloud detection method based on the synergistic combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a physics-based cloud distortion model (CDM). The proposed weakly-supervised GAN-CDM method (available online https://github.com/Neooolee/GANCDM) only requires patch-level labels for training, and can produce cloud masks at pixel-level in both training and testing stages. GAN-CDM is trained on a new globally distributed Landsat 8 dataset (WHUL8-CDb, available online doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6420027) including image blocks and corresponding block-level labels. Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-CDM method trained on Landsat 8 image blocks achieves much higher cloud detection accuracy than baseline deep learning-based methods, not only in Landsat 8 images (L8 Biome dataset, 90.20\% versus 72.09\%) but also in Sentinel-2 images ("S2 Cloud Mask Catalogue" dataset, 92.54\% versus 77.00\%). This suggests that the proposed method provides accurate cloud detection in Landsat images, has good transferability to Sentinel-2 images, and can quickly be adapted for different optical satellite sensors.},

	abstract = {Many parameter estimation problems arising in applications can be cast in the framework of Bayesian inversion. This allows not only for an estimate of the parameters, but also for the quantification of uncertainties in the estimates. Often in such problems the parameter-to-data map is very expensive to evaluate, and computing derivatives of the map, or derivative-adjoints, may not be feasible. Additionally, in many applications only noisy evaluations of the map may be available. We propose an approach to Bayesian inversion in such settings that builds on the derivative-free optimization capabilities of ensemble Kalman inversion methods. The overarching approach is to first use ensemble Kalman sampling (EKS) to calibrate the unknown parameters to fit the data; second, to use the output of the EKS to emulate the parameter-to-data map; third, to sample from an approximate Bayesian posterior distribution in which the parameter-to-data map is replaced by its emulator. This results in a principled approach to approximate Bayesian inference that requires only a small number of evaluations of the (possibly noisy approximation of the) parameter-to-data map. It does not require derivatives of this map, but instead leverages the documented power of ensemble Kalman methods. Furthermore, the EKS has the desirable property that it evolves the parameter ensemble towards the regions in which the bulk of the parameter posterior mass is located, thereby locating them well for the emulation phase of the methodology. In essence, the EKS methodology provides a cheap solution to the design problem of where to place points in parameter space to efficiently train an emulator of the parameter-to-data map for the purposes of Bayesian inversion.},

	abstract = {Modeled differences in predicted effects are increasingly used to help quantify the uncertainty of these effects. Here, we examine modeled differences in the aerosol indirect effect in a series of experiments that help to quantify how and why model-predicted aerosol indirect forcing varies between models. The experiments start with an experiment in which aerosol concentrations, the parameterization of droplet concentrations and the autoconversion scheme are all specified and end with an experiment that examines the predicted aerosol indirect forcing when only aerosol sources are specified. Although there are large differences in the predicted liquid water path among the models, the predicted aerosol first indirect effect for the first experiment is rather similar, about −0.6 Wm−2 to −0.7 Wm−2. Changes to the autoconversion scheme can lead to large changes in the liquid water path of the models and to the response of the liquid water path to changes in aerosols. Adding an autoconversion scheme that depends on the droplet concentration caused a larger (negative) change in net outgoing shortwave radiation compared to the 1st indirect effect, and the increase varied from only 22\% to more than a factor of three. The change in net shortwave forcing in the models due to varying the autoconversion scheme depends on the liquid water content of the clouds as well as their predicted droplet concentrations, and both increases and decreases in the net shortwave forcing can occur when autoconversion schemes are changed. The parameterization of cloud fraction within models is not sensitive to the aerosol concentration, and, therefore, the response of the modeled cloud fraction within the present models appears to be smaller than that which would be associated with model "noise". The prediction of aerosol concentrations, given a fixed set of sources, leads to some of the largest differences in the predicted aerosol indirect radiative forcing among the models, with values of cloud forcing ranging from −0.3 Wm−2 to −1.4 Wm−2. Thus, this aspect of modeling requires significant improvement in order to improve the prediction of aerosol indirect effects.},

This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aerosol-cloud interactions constitute the largest source of uncertainty in assessments of anthropogenic climate change. This uncertainty arises in part from the difficulty in measuring the vertical distributions of aerosols, and only sporadic vertically resolved observations are available. We often have to settle for less informative vertically aggregated proxies such as aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this work, we develop a framework for the vertical disaggregation of AOD into extinction profiles, that is, the measure of light extinction throughout an atmospheric column, using readily available vertically resolved meteorological predictors such as temperature, pressure, or relative humidity. Using Bayesian nonparametric modeling, we devise a simple Gaussian process prior over aerosol vertical profiles and update it with AOD observations to infer a distribution over vertical extinction profiles. To validate our approach, we use ECHAM-HAM aerosol-climate model data which offers self-consistent simulations of meteorological covariates, AOD, and extinction profiles. Our results show that, while very simple, our model is able to reconstruct realistic extinction profiles with well-calibrated uncertainty, outperforming by an order of magnitude the idealized baseline which is typically used in satellite AOD retrieval algorithms. In particular, the model demonstrates a faithful reconstruction of extinction patterns arising from aerosol water uptake in the boundary layer. Observations however suggest that other extinction patterns, due to aerosol mass concentration, particle size, and radiative properties, might be more challenging to capture and require additional vertically resolved predictors.},

	abstract = {Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are considered to be the most uncertain driver of present-day radiative forcing due to human activities. The nonlinearity of cloud-state changes to aerosol perturbations make it challenging to attribute causality in observed relationships of aerosol radiative forcing. Using correlations to infer causality can be challenging when meteorological variability also drives both aerosol and cloud changes independently. Natural and anthropogenic aerosol perturbations from well-defined sources provide “opportunistic experiments” (also known as natural experiments) to investigate ACI in cases where causality may be more confidently inferred. These perturbations cover a wide range of locations and spatiotemporal scales, including point sources such as volcanic eruptions or industrial sources, plumes from biomass burning or forest fires, and tracks from individual ships or shipping corridors. We review the different experimental conditions and conduct a synthesis of the available satellite datasets and field campaigns to place these opportunistic experiments on a common footing, facilitating new insights and a clearer understanding of key uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing. Cloud albedo perturbations are strongly sensitive to background meteorological conditions. Strong liquid water path increases due to aerosol perturbations are largely ruled out by averaging across experiments. Opportunistic experiments have significantly improved process-level understanding of ACI, but it remains unclear how reliably the relationships found can be scaled to the global level, thus demonstrating a need for deeper investigation in order to improve assessments of aerosol radiative forcing and climate change.},

	abstract = {Aerosol–cloud interactions are considered a key uncertainty in our understanding of climate change (Boucher et al., 2013). Knowledge of the global abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is fundamental to determine the strength of the anthropogenic climate perturbation. Direct measurements are limited and sample only a very small fraction of the globe so that remote sensing from satellites and ground-based instruments is widely used as a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (Nakajima et al., 2001; Andreae, 2009; Clarke and Kapustin, 2010; Boucher et al., 2013). However, the underlying assumptions cannot be robustly tested with the small number of measurements available so that no reliable global estimate of cloud condensation nuclei exists. This study overcomes this limitation using a self-consistent global model (ECHAM-HAM) of aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei. An analysis of the correlation of simulated aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei reveals that common assumptions about their relationships are violated for a significant fraction of the globe: 71 \% of the area of the globe shows correlation coefficients between CCN0.2 \% at cloud base and aerosol optical depth (AOD) below 0.5, i.e. AOD variability explains only 25 \% of the CCN variance. This has significant implications for satellite based studies of aerosol–cloud interactions. The findings also suggest that vertically resolved remote-sensing techniques, such as satellite-based high spectral resolution lidars, have a large potential for global monitoring of cloud condensation nuclei.},

	abstract = {The effect of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud droplet concentrations and radiative properties is the source of one of the largest uncertainties in the radiative forcing of climate over the industrial period. This uncertainty affects our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in the uncertainty of forcing estimates. It has been assumed that a better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic aerosols will greatly reduce the large uncertainties associated with our predictions of the radiative forcing effects of aerosols on climate; however, this study shows that nearly half of the uncertainty in the radiative effect of aerosols on clouds derives from uncertainties in pre-industrial natural aerosols. Firmly establishing the influence of aerosols on cloud albedo — their forcing effect on climate in essence — is one of the greatest challenges of modern climate science. It is often tacitly assumed that the continued high uncertainties are linked mainly to anthropogenic emissions. In other words, if the anthropogenic effects could be better understood, so would the overall effect. Now Ken Carslaw and colleagues present an analysis of 28 parameters representing aerosol and precursor gas emissions and other factors that could influence cloud brightness. They find that only 34 per cent of the variance in aerosol forcing since pre-industrial times (around 1750) is associated with anthropogenic emissions, with 45 per cent of the variance linked to natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide and other natural sources. This work casts doubts on the degree of progress that can be made solely through advances in the understanding of anthropogenic aerosols and suggests that we need to discover more about the workings of the pre-industrial environment, when natural aerosols were predominant.},

Together with 13 CMIP5 simulations, this PPE provides users with a dataset that samples modelling uncertainty and is ideal for use in impacts studies. Evaluations of global mean surface temperatures for this PPE have shown twenty-first century warming rates consistently at the top end of the CMIP5 range. Here we investigate one potential contributory factor to this lack of spread: that the methodology to select plausible members from a larger, related PPE of atmosphere-only experiments preferentially ruled out those predicted to have more negative climate feedbacks (i.e. lower climate sensitivities). We confirm that this is indeed the case. We show that performance in extratropical long-wave cloud forcing played a key role in this by constraining ice cloud parameters, which in turn constrained the feedback distribution (though causal links are not established). The relatively weak relationship driving this constraint is shown to arise from stronger relationships for the long-wave and short-wave cloud feedback components, which largely cancel out due to changes in tropical high clouds. Moreover, we show that the strength of these constraints is due to a structural bias in extratropical long-wave cloud forcing across the PPE.

	abstract = {Many statistical models in cosmology can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihood functions. Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to perform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations, free from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the observed data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive asymptotically-optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we present the first cosmological application of Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference ({\textbackslash}textsc\{delfi\}), which learns a parameterized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data, as a simple validation case study. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological datasets.},

	abstract = {Most signal processing problems involve the challenging task of multidimensional probability density function (PDF) estimation. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by using a family of rotation-based iterative Gaussianization (RBIG) transforms. The general framework consists of the sequential application of a univariate marginal Gaussianization transform followed by an orthonormal transform. The proposed procedure looks for differentiable transforms to a known PDF so that the unknown PDF can be estimated at any point of the original domain. In particular, we aim at a zero-mean unit-covariance Gaussian for convenience. RBIG is formally similar to classical iterative projection pursuit algorithms. However, we show that, unlike in PP methods, the particular class of rotations used has no special qualitative relevance in this context, since looking for interestingness is not a critical issue for PDF estimation. The key difference is that our approach focuses on the univariate part (marginal Gaussianization) of the problem rather than on the multivariate part (rotation). This difference implies that one may select the most convenient rotation suited to each practical application. The differentiability, invertibility, and convergence of RBIG are theoretically and experimentally analyzed. Relation to other methods, such as radial Gaussianization, one-class support vector domain description, and deep neural networks is also pointed out. The practical performance of RBIG is successfully illustrated in a number of multidimensional problems such as image synthesis, classification, denoising, and multi-information estimation.},

Emissions of sulfur dioxide and reactive sulfur to the atmosphere have caused widespread health and environmental impacts and have led, ultimately, to calls to decrease sulfur emissions. However, anthropogenic modification of the sulfur cycle is far from over. Using four contrasting case studies from across the United States, we show how high levels of sulfur are added to croplands as fertilizers and pesticides and constitute a major yet under-studied environmental perturbation. Long-term sulfur additions to crops probably cause similar consequences for the health of soil and downstream aquatic ecosystems as those observed in regions historically impacted by acid rain, yet the cascade of effects has not been broadly explored. A new wave of research on the sulfur cycle will require studies that examine the integrated roles of climate, hydrology and other element cycles in modifying sulfur processes and flows within and downgradient of agricultural source areas. Such research must include not only scientists, but also farmers, regulating authorities and land managers who are engaged in developing approaches to monitor and mitigate environmental and human health impacts. Deliberate application of sulfur onto croplands as fertilizer and pesticide probably causes environmental damage similar to historical acid rain events, according to a literature review and four case studies from the United States.},

As global temperatures increase, these previously rare events are becoming more common. Being able to predict which fires are likely to generate pyroCb is therefore key to climate adaptation in wildfire-prone areas. This paper introduces Pyrocast, a pipeline for pyroCb analysis and forecasting. The pipeline's first two components, a pyroCb database and a pyroCb forecast model, are presented. The database brings together geostationary imagery and environmental data for over 148 pyroCb events across North America, Australia, and Russia between 2018 and 2022. Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and CNNs pretrained with Auto-Encoders were tested to predict the generation of pyroCb for a given fire six hours in advance. The best model predicted pyroCb with an AUC of \$0.90 {\textbackslash}pm 0.04\$.},

The improvements to the ocean model physical processes include new parameterizations to represent previously missing physics and modifications of existing parameterizations to incorporate recent new developments. In comparison with CCSM3, the new solutions show some significant improvements that can be attributed to these model changes. These include a better equatorial current structure, a sharper thermocline, and elimination of the cold bias of the equatorial cold tongue all in the Pacific Ocean; reduced sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases along the North Atlantic Current path; and much smaller potential temperature and salinity biases in the near-surface Pacific Ocean. Other improvements include a global-mean SST that is more consistent with the present-day observations due to a different spinup procedure from that used in CCSM3. Despite these improvements, many of the biases present in CCSM3 still exist in CCSM4. A major concern continues to be the substantial heat content loss in the ocean during the preindustrial control simulation from which the 20C cases start. This heat loss largely reflects the top of the atmospheric model heat loss rate in the coupled system, and it essentially determines the abyssal ocean potential temperature biases in the 20C simulations. There is also a deep salty bias in all basins. As a result of this latter bias in the deep North Atlantic, the parameterized overflow waters cannot penetrate much deeper than in CCSM3.},

In the tropics, more (less) convective mass flux is associated with more (less) precipitation and more (less) aerosol vertical dispersivity—including more (less) aerosol above 500 hPa. In contrast, a negative relationship exists between aerosol vertical dispersivity and both convective mass flux and precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude ocean. Aerosol vertical dispersivity in this region is related to convective mass flux and precipitation over the emission sources.

This review focuses on the aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), an instrument designed and developed at Aerodyne Research, Inc. (ARI) that is the most widely used thermal vaporization AMS. The AMS uses aerodynamic lens inlet technology together with thermal vaporization and electron-impact mass spectrometry to measure the real-time non-refractory (NR) chemical speciation and mass loading as a function of particle size of fine aerosol particles with aerodynamic diameters between ∼50 and 1,000 nm. The original AMS utilizes a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Q) with electron impact (EI) ionization and produces ensemble average data of particle properties. Later versions employ time-of-flight (ToF) mass spectrometers and can produce full mass spectral data for single particles. This manuscript presents a detailed discussion of the strengths and limitations of the AMS measurement approach and reviews how the measurements are used to characterize particle properties. Results from selected laboratory experiments and field measurement campaigns are also presented to highlight the different applications of this instrument. Recent instrumental developments, such as the incorporation of softer ionization techniques (vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photo-ionization, Li+ ion, and electron attachment) and high-resolution ToF mass spectrometers, that yield more detailed information about the organic aerosol component are also described. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 26:185–222, 2007},

	abstract = {We describe the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's CM4.0 physical climate model, with emphasis on those aspects that may be of particular importance to users of this model and its simulations. The model is built with the AM4.0/LM4.0 atmosphere/land model and OM4.0 ocean model. Topics include the rationale for key choices made in the model formulation, the stability as well as drift of the preindustrial control simulation, and comparison of key aspects of the historical simulations with observations from recent decades. Notable achievements include the relatively small biases in seasonal spatial patterns of top‐of‐atmosphere fluxes, surface temperature, and precipitation; reduced double Intertropical Convergence Zone bias; dramatically improved representation of ocean boundary currents; a high‐quality simulation of climatological Arctic sea ice extent and its recent decline; and excellent simulation of the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation spectrum and structure. Areas of concern include inadequate deep convection in the Nordic Seas; an inaccurate Antarctic sea ice simulation; precipitation and wind composites still affected by the equatorial cold tongue bias; muted variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation; strong 100 year quasiperiodicity in Southern Ocean ventilation; and a lack of historical warming before 1990 and too rapid warming thereafter due to high climate sensitivity and strong aerosol forcing, in contrast to the observational record. Overall, CM4.0 scores very well in its fidelity against observations compared to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 generation in terms of both mean state and modes of variability and should prove a valuable new addition for analysis across a broad array of applications. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration participates along with a number of model centers around the world in constructing state‐of‐the‐art climate models for use in studies for climate change and prediction. GFDL's latest multipurpose atmosphere‐ocean coupled climate model, CM4.0, is described here. It consists of GFDL's latest atmosphere and land models at about 100 km horizontal resolution and ocean and sea ice models at roughly 25 km horizontal resolution. A handful of standard experiments have been conducted with CM4.0 for participation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, an archive of climate model results utilized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the climate research community more generally. The model results have been extensively evaluated against observations. This paper makes the case that CM4.0 ranks high among state‐of‐the‐art coupled climate models by many measures of bias in the simulated climatology and in its ability to capture modes of climate variability such as the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation and Madden‐Julian Oscillation. The paper also discusses some potential weaknesses, including unrealistically large internal variability in the Southern Ocean and insufficient warming before 1990 in the simulation of the twentieth century. A team at GFDL has developed a new model of the physical climate system referred to as CM4.0 Strengths of model include ENSO simulation and small biases in TOA fluxes, precipitation, Arctic sea ice extent, and sea surface temperature Problematic aspects include large variability in Southern Ocean and historical simulation with little warming prior to 1990},

Here we develop a stochastic parameterization of shallow cumulus clouds to address the first two points, and we study how this stochastic parameterization interacts with the under-resolved convective circulations in a convective case over the ocean. We couple a stochastic model based on a canonical ensemble of shallow cumuli to the Eddy-Diffusivity Mass-Flux parameterization in the icosahedral nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. The moist-convective area fraction is perturbed by subsampling the distribution of subgrid convective states. These stochastic perturbations represent scale-dependent fluctuations around the quasi-equilibrium state of a shallow cumulus ensemble. The stochastic parameterization reproduces the average and higher order statistics of the shallow cumulus case adequately and converges to the reference statistics with increasing model resolution. The interaction of parameterizations with model dynamics, which is usually not considered when parameterizations are developed, causes a significant influence on convection in the gray zone. The stochastic parameterization interacts strongly with the model dynamics, which changes the regime and energetics of the convective flows compared to the deterministic simulations. As a result of this interaction, the emergence of convective circulations in combination with the stochastic parameterization can even be beneficial on the high-resolution model grids.},

The dominant discriminants of twentieth-century variations in surface temperature exhibit large-scale warming in which, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere summer months, localized cooling is embedded. The structure of the large-scale warming is consistent with expected effects of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations.

These temperature effects may be beneficial but are almost certainly overwhelmed by aerosols’ negative health impacts3. Recent analyses of economic impacts have concluded that warming harms economies in warm climates, but provides economic benefits in cold climates4. Here we investigate whether aerosol-induced cooling would have a positive effect on less wealthy economies in hotter regions and a negative effect on wealthier economies in colder regions. Climate simulations over the historical period both with and without anthropogenic aerosol emissions, using a fully coupled ocean and atmosphere climate model, indicate that in year 2010 anthropogenic aerosol emissions were cooling the Earth by 0.72 ± 0.02 °C relative to a scenario without such emissions. Due to opposing economic impacts in different regions, the net economic impact of aerosol-induced cooling is likely to be small at the global scale. However, these results suggest that the cooling effects of anthropogenic aerosols benefit developing tropical economies while harming developed high-latitude economies, and thus the temperature effects of past aerosol emissions have probably diminished global economic inequality. Anthropogenic aerosols mask some greenhouse warming via radiation scattering and cloud interactions. Research suggests the economic impact of this aerosol-induced cooling was small globally, although it benefitted developing countries in warm climates and harmed high-latitude developed countries.},

At constant cloud amount, morphology patterns differ in brightness associated with the amount of optically thin cloud features. Environmentally driven transitions from closed MCC to other morphology patterns, typically accompanied by more optically thin cloud features, are used as a framework to quantify the morphology contribution to the optical depth component of the shortwave cloud feedback. A marine heat wave is used as an out‐of‐sample test of closed MCC occurrence predictions. Morphology shifts in optical depth between 65°S and 65°N under projected environmental changes (i.e., from an abrupt quadrupling of CO 2 ) assuming constant cloud cover contributes between 0.04 and 0.07 W m −2  K −1 (aggregate of 0.06) to the global mean cloud feedback.},

The basis of this analysis was self‐organizing maps (SOMs), a neural network algorithm, used to identify the range of potential temperature profiles present in the twice‐daily radiosonde data during the ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement) West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) campaign. The SOM identified profiles ranging from strongly stable to weakly stable regimes over the lowest 500 m of the atmosphere. It was found that in the winter (MJJA), moderate and strongly stable regimes occur most frequently (61\%), while weakly stable regimes dominate in the summer (DJ, 83.4\%). The mechanisms responsible for the dominance of different stability regimes in each season were analyzed to determine why these regimes occur with varying frequency throughout the year. This analysis found that wind speed variations and radiative cooling are responsible for the stability observed in the winter, radiative warming, as well as weaker wind speeds, are responsible for summer weak stability, and stability variations in the transition seasons (FMA, SON) are characterized by a change in sign of net radiation with increasing stability, as wind speed changes little across stability regimes. Low‐level jets were observed to occur about 50\% of the time below areas of enhanced stability aloft and were observed most frequently in the transition seasons. The boundary layer depth, as determined by the Bulk Richardson number, was found to decrease with increasing stability.

	abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interactions have the potential to modify many different cloud properties. There is significant uncertainty in the strength of these aerosol-cloud interactions in analyses of observational data, partly due to the difficulty in separating aerosol effects on clouds from correlations generated by local meteorology. The relationship between aerosol and cloud fraction (CF) is particularly important to determine, due to the strong correlation of CF to other cloud properties and its large impact on radiation. It has also been one of the hardest to quantify from satellites due to the strong meteorological covariations involved. This work presents a new method to analyze the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and CF. By including information about the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the impact of the meteorological covariations is significantly reduced. This method shows that much of the AOD-CF correlation is explained by relationships other than that mediated by CDNC. By accounting for these, the strength of the global mean AOD-CF relationship is reduced by around 80\%. This suggests that the majority of the AOD-CF relationship is due to meteorological covariations, especially in the shallow cumulus regime. Requiring CDNC to mediate the AOD-CF relationship implies an effective anthropogenic radiative forcing from an aerosol influence on liquid CF of −0.48 W m−2 (−0.1 to −0.64 W m−2), although some uncertainty remains due to possible biases in the CDNC retrievals in broken cloud scenes.},

Here a multiobjective approach is applied to a large set of subensembles generated from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 ensemble. We use observations and reanalyses to constrain tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, upper level zonal winds in the midlatitude Pacific, and California precipitation. An evolutionary algorithm identifies the set of Pareto‐optimal subensembles across these three measures, and these subensembles are used to constrain end‐of‐century California wet season precipitation change. This methodology narrows the range of projections throughout California, increasing confidence in estimates of positive mean precipitation change. Finally, we show how this technique complements and generalizes emergent constraint approaches for restricting uncertainty in end‐of‐century projections within multimodel ensembles using multiple criteria for observational constraints. Multiobjective optimization applied to multiple observational climate model constraints helps generalize emergent constraint approaches Subensembles interpolate model spatial fields and aid evolutionary algorithm estimation of a robust Pareto front for historical constraints Model subensembles that are Pareto‐optimal by observational criteria are used to constrain projections of future California precipitation},

The G-V made vertically-resolved measurements of turbulence, cloud microphysics, aerosol characteristics, and trace gases. It also carried dropsondes and a vertically-pointing W-band radar and lidar. This paper summarizes these observations with the goals of fostering novel comparisons with theory, models and reanalyses, and satellite-derived products. A longitude-height binning and compositing strategy mitigates limitations of sparse sampling and spatiotemporal variability. Typically, a 1 km deep decoupled stratocumulus-capped boundary layer near California evolved into 2 km deep precipitating cumulus clusters surrounded by patches of thin stratus that dissipated toward Hawaii. Low cloud cover was correlated with estimated inversion strength more than with cloud droplet number, even though the thickest clouds were generally precipitating and ultraclean layers indicative of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction were common west of 140°W. Accumulation-mode aerosol concentration correlated well with collocated cloud droplet number concentration and was typically largest near the surface. Aitken mode aerosol concentration was typically larger in the free troposphere. Wildfire smoke produced spikes of aerosol and trace gases on some flights. CSET data are compared with space-time collocated output from MERRA-2 reanalysis and from the CAM6 climate model run with winds and temperature nudged toward this reanalysis. The reanalysis compares better with the observed relative humidity than does nudged CAM6. Both vertically diffuse the stratocumulus cloud layer vs. observations. MERRA-2 slightly underestimates in-situ carbon monoxide measurements and underestimates ozone depletion within the boundary layer.},

It is shown that alternating densities of negative and positive links (correlations) are arranged in half Rossby wave distances around 3,500 km, 7,000 km and 10,000 km and are aligned with the expected direction of energy flow, distribution of time delays and the seasonality of these waves. It is also shown that long distance links (i.e., of distances larger than 2,000 km) that are associated with Rossby waves are the most dominant in the climate network. Climate networks may thus be used as an efficient new way to detect and analyze Rossby waves, based on reliable and available ground level measurements, in addition to the frequently used 300 hPa reanalysis meridional wind data.},

	abstract = {To study climate change on multi-millennial timescales or to explore a model's parameter space, efficient models with simplified and parameterised processes are required. However, the reduction in explicitly modelled processes can lead to underestimation of some atmospheric responses that are essential to the understanding of the climate system. While more complex general circulations are available and capable of simulating a more realistic climate, they are too computationally intensive for these purposes. In this work, we propose a multi-level Gaussian emulation technique to efficiently estimate the outputs of steady-state simulations of an expensive atmospheric model in response to changes in boundary forcing. The link between a computationally expensive atmospheric model, PLASIM (Planet Simulator), and a cheaper model, EMBM (energy–moisture balance model), is established through the common boundary condition specified by an ocean model, allowing for information to be propagated from one to the other. This technique allows PLASIM emulators to be built at a low cost. The method is first demonstrated by emulating a scalar summary quantity, the global mean surface air temperature. It is then employed to emulate the dimensionally reduced 2-D surface air temperature field. Even though the two atmospheric models chosen are structurally unrelated, Gaussian process emulators of PLASIM atmospheric variables are successfully constructed using EMBM as a fast approximation. With the extra information gained from the cheap model, the multi-level emulator of PLASIM's 2-D surface air temperature field is built using only one-third the amount of expensive data required by the normal single-level technique. The constructed emulator is shown to capture 93.2 \% of the variance across the validation ensemble, with the averaged RMSE of 1.33 °C. Using the method proposed, quantities from PLASIM can be constructed and used to study the effects introduced by PLASIM's atmosphere.},

While the purpose of these surrogates may differ, their development is often very similar. Here we introduce ESEm: an open-source tool providing a general workflow for emulating and validating a wide variety of models and outputs. It includes efficient routines for sampling these emulators for the purpose of uncertainty quantification and model calibration. It is built on well-established, high-performance libraries to ensure robustness, extensibility and scalability.

	abstract = {Aerosol radiative forcing and cloud–climate feedbacks each have a large effect on climate, mainly through modification of solar short-wave radiative fluxes. Here we determine what causes the long-term trends in the upwelling short-wave (SW) top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes (FSW↑) over the North Atlantic region. Coupled atmosphere–ocean simulations from the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) and the Hadley Centre General Environment Model (HadGEM3-GC3.1) show a positive FSW↑ trend between 1850 and 1970 (increasing SW reflection) and a negative trend between 1970 and 2014. We find that the 1850–1970 positive FSW↑ trend is mainly driven by an increase in cloud droplet number concentration due to increases in aerosol, while the 1970–2014 trend is mainly driven by a decrease in cloud fraction, which we attribute mainly to cloud feedbacks caused by greenhouse gas-induced warming. In the 1850–1970 period, aerosol-induced cooling and greenhouse gas warming roughly counteract each other, so the temperature-driven cloud feedback effect on the FSW↑ trend is weak (contributing to only 23 \% of the ΔFSW↑), and aerosol forcing is the dominant effect (77 \% of ΔFSW↑). However, in the 1970–2014 period the warming from greenhouse gases intensifies, and the cooling from aerosol radiative forcing reduces, resulting in a large overall warming and a reduction in FSW↑ that is mainly driven by cloud feedbacks (87 \% of ΔFSW↑). The results suggest that it is difficult to use satellite observations in the post-1970 period to evaluate and constrain the magnitude of the aerosol–cloud interaction forcing but that cloud feedbacks might be evaluated. Comparisons with observations between 1985 and 2014 show that the simulated reduction in FSW↑ and the increase in temperature are too strong. However, the temperature discrepancy can account for only part of the FSW↑ discrepancy given the estimated model feedback strength (λ=∂FSW∂T). The remaining discrepancy suggests a model bias in either λ or in the strength of the aerosol forcing (aerosols are reducing during this time period) to explain the too-strong decrease in FSW↑, with a λ bias being the most likely. Both of these biases would also tend to cause too-large an increase in temperature over the 1985–2014 period, which would be consistent with the sign of the model temperature bias reported here. Either of these model biases would have important implications for future climate projections using these models.},

Using the one‐at‐a‐time method, the benefit of tuning one parameter may offset the benefit of tuning another parameter, or improvement in one target variable may lead to degradation in another target variable. To better understand the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 model behaviors and physics, we conducted a large number of short simulations (three days) in which 18 parameters carefully selected from parameterizations of deep convection, shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics and microphysics were perturbed simultaneously using the Latin hypercube sampling method. From the perturbed parameter ensemble simulations and use of different skill score functions, we identified the most sensitive parameters, quantified how the model responds to changes of the parameters for both global mean and spatial distribution, and estimated the maximum likelihood of model parameter space for a number of important fidelity metrics. Comparison of the parametric sensitivity using simulations of two different lengths suggests that perturbed parameter ensemble using short simulations has some bearing on understanding parametric sensitivity of longer simulations. Results from this analysis provide a more comprehensive picture of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 behavior. The difficulty in reducing biases in multiple variables simultaneously highlights the need of characterizing model structural uncertainty (so‐called embedded errors) to inform future development efforts.

	abstract = {We present a new version of the Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit global surface temperature data set, HadCRUT5. HadCRUT5 presents monthly average near‐surface temperature anomalies, relative to the 1961–1990 period, on a regular 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid from 1850 to 2018. HadCRUT5 is a combination of sea‐surface temperature (SST) measurements over the ocean from ships and buoys and near‐surface air temperature measurements from weather stations over the land surface. These data have been sourced from updated compilations and the adjustments applied to mitigate the impact of changes in SST measurement methods have been revised. Two variants of HadCRUT5 have been produced for use in different applications. The first represents temperature anomaly data on a grid for locations where measurement data are available. The second, more spatially complete, variant uses a Gaussian process based statistical method to make better use of the available observations, extending temperature anomaly estimates into regions for which the underlying measurements are informative. Each is provided as a 200‐member ensemble accompanied by additional uncertainty information. The combination of revised input data sets and statistical analysis results in greater warming of the global average over the course of the whole record. In recent years, increased warming results from an improved representation of Arctic warming and a better understanding of evolving biases in SST measurements from ships. These updates result in greater consistency with other independent global surface temperature data sets, despite their different approaches to data set construction, and further increase confidence in our understanding of changes seen. We have produced a new version of a data set that measures changes of near‐surface temperature across the globe from 1850 to 2018, called HadCRUT5. We have included an improved data set of sea‐surface temperature, which better accounts for the effects of changes through time in how measurement were made from ships and buoys at sea. We have also included an expanded compilation of measurements made at weather stations on land. There are two variations of HadCRUT5, produced for different uses. The first, the “HadCRUT5 noninfilled data set,” maps temperature changes on a grid for locations close to where we have measurements. The second, the “HadCRUT5 analysis,” extends our estimates to locations further from the available measurements using a statistical technique that makes use of the spatial connectedness of temperature patterns. This improves the representation of less well observed regions in estimates of global, hemispheric and regional temperature change. Together, these updates and improvements reveal a slightly greater rise in near‐surface temperature since the nineteenth century, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, which is more consistent with other data sets. This increases our confidence in our understanding of global surface temperature changes since the mid‐19th century. We have created a new version of the Met Office Hadley Centre and Climatic Research Unit global surface temperature data set for 1850–2018 The new data set better represents sparsely observed regions of the globe and incorporates an improved sea‐surface temperature data set This data set shows increased global average warming since the mid‐19th century and in recent years, consistent with other analyses We have created a new version of the Met Office Hadley Centre and Climatic Research Unit global surface temperature data set for 1850–2018 The new data set better represents sparsely observed regions of the globe and incorporates an improved sea‐surface temperature data set This data set shows increased global average warming since the mid‐19th century and in recent years, consistent with other analyses},

Many stakeholders -- such as researchers, policy makers, and insurers -- use this data to better understand the earth system and guide policy decisions. Atmospheric states have also received increased interest as machine learning approaches to weather prediction have shown promising results. A key issue for all audiences is that dense time series of these high-dimensional states comprise an enormous amount of data, precluding all but the most well resourced groups from accessing and using historical data and future projections. To address this problem, we propose a method for compressing atmospheric states using methods from the neural network literature, adapting spherical data to processing by conventional neural architectures through the use of the area-preserving HEALPix projection. We investigate two model classes for building neural compressors: the hyperprior model from the neural image compression literature and recent vector-quantised models. We show that both families of models satisfy the desiderata of small average error, a small number of high-error reconstructed pixels, faithful reproduction of extreme events such as hurricanes and heatwaves, preservation of the spectral power distribution across spatial scales. We demonstrate compression ratios in excess of 1000x, with compression and decompression at a rate of approximately one second per global atmospheric state.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A wide range of estimates exists for the radiative forcing of the aerosol effect on cloud albedo. We argue that a component of this uncertainty derives from the use of a wide range of observational scales and platforms. Aerosol influences cloud properties at the microphysical scale, or the "process scale", but observations are most often made of bulk properties over a wide range of resolutions, or "analysis scales". We show that differences between process and analysis scales incur biases in quantification of the albedo effect through the impact that data aggregation and computational approach have on statistical properties of the aerosol or cloud variable, and their covariance. Measures made within this range of scales are erroneously treated as equivalent, leading to a large uncertainty in associated radiative forcing estimates. Issues associated with the coarsening of observational resolution particular to quantifying the albedo effect are discussed. Specifically, the omission of the constraint on cloud liquid water path and the separation in space of cloud and aerosol properties from passive, space-based remote sensors dampen the measured strength of the albedo effect. We argue that, because of this lack of constraints, many of these values are in fact more representative of the full range of aerosol-cloud interactions and their associated feedbacks. Based on our understanding of these biases we propose a new observationally-based and process-model-constrained, method for estimating aerosol-cloud interactions that can be used for radiative forcing estimates as well as a better characterization of the uncertainties associated with those estimates.},

	abstract = {Abstract Neural networks are a promising technique for parameterizing subgrid-scale physics (e.g., moist atmospheric convection) in coarse-resolution climate models, but their lack of interpretability and reliability prevents widespread adoption. For instance, it is not fully understood why neural network parameterizations often cause dramatic instability when coupled to atmospheric fluid dynamics. This paper introduces tools for interpreting their behavior that are customized to the parameterization task. First, we assess the nonlinear sensitivity of a neural network to lower-tropospheric stability and the midtropospheric moisture, two widely studied controls of moist convection. Second, we couple the linearized response functions of these neural networks to simplified gravity wave dynamics, and analytically diagnose the corresponding phase speeds, growth rates, wavelengths, and spatial structures. To demonstrate their versatility, these techniques are tested on two sets of neural networks, one trained with a superparameterized version of the Community Atmosphere Model (SPCAM) and the second with a near-global cloud-resolving model (GCRM). Even though the SPCAM simulation has a warmer climate than the cloud-resolving model, both neural networks predict stronger heating/drying in moist and unstable environments, which is consistent with observations. Moreover, the spectral analysis can predict that instability occurs when GCMs are coupled to networks that support gravity waves that are unstable and have phase speeds larger than 5 m s −1 . In contrast, standing unstable modes do not cause catastrophic instability. Using these tools, differences between the SPCAM-trained versus GCRM-trained neural networks are analyzed, and strategies to incrementally improve both of their coupled online performance unveiled.},

Simulations of scattered convective clouds near Houston, Texas, are conducted, after being initialized with both relatively low and high CCN concentrations. Deep convective updrafts are identified, and trends in the updraft intensity and frequency are assessed. The factors contributing to the vertical velocity tendencies are examined to identify the physical processes associated with the CCN-induced updraft changes. The models show several consistent trends. In general, the changes between the High-CCN and Low-CCN simulations in updraft magnitudes throughout the depth of the troposphere are within 15\% for all of the models. All models produce stronger ({\textasciitilde}+5\%–15\%) mean updrafts from {\textasciitilde}4–7 km above ground level (AGL) in the High-CCN simulations, followed by a waning response up to {\textasciitilde}8 km AGL in most of the models. Thermal buoyancy was more sensitive than condensate loading to varying CCN concentrations in most of the models and more impactful in the mean updraft responses. However, there are also differences between the models. The change in the amount of deep convective updrafts varies significantly. Furthermore, approximately half the models demonstrate neutral-to-weaker ({\textasciitilde}−5\% to 0\%) updrafts above {\textasciitilde}8 km AGL, while the other models show stronger ({\textasciitilde}+10\%) updrafts in the High-CCN simulations. The combination of the CCN-induced impacts on the buoyancy and vertical perturbation pressure gradient terms better explains these middle- and upper-tropospheric updraft trends than the buoyancy terms alone.},

	abstract = {The authors study the effect of clouds on the atmospheric circulation response to CO2 quadrupling in an aquaplanet model with a slab ocean lower boundary. The cloud effect is isolated by locking the clouds to either the control or 4xCO2 state in the shortwave (SW) or longwave (LW) radiation schemes. In the model, cloud radiative changes explain more than half of the total poleward expansion of the Hadley cells, midlatitude jets, and storm tracks under CO2 quadrupling, even though they cause only one-fourth of the total global-mean surface warming. The effect of clouds on circulation results mainly from the SW cloud radiative changes, which strongly enhance the equator-to-pole temperature gradient at all levels in the troposphere, favoring stronger and poleward-shifted midlatitude eddies. By contrast, quadrupling CO2 while holding the clouds fixed causes strong polar amplification and weakened midlatitude baroclinicity at lower levels, yielding only a small poleward expansion of the circulation. The results show that 1) the atmospheric circulation responds sensitively to cloud-driven changes in meridional and vertical temperature distribution and 2) the spatial structure of cloud feedbacks likely plays a dominant role in the circulation response to greenhouse gas forcing. While the magnitude and spatial structure of the cloud feedback are expected to be highly model dependent, an analysis of 4xCO2 simulations of CMIP5 models shows that the SW cloud feedback likely forces a poleward expansion of the tropospheric circulation in most climate models.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a summary of the work done within the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ECLIPSE (Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants). ECLIPSE had a unique systematic concept for designing a realistic and effective mitigation scenario for short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs; methane, aerosols and ozone, and their precursor species) and quantifying its climate and air quality impacts, and this paper presents the results in the context of this overarching strategy. The first step in ECLIPSE was to create a new emission inventory based on current legislation (CLE) for the recent past and until 2050. Substantial progress compared to previous work was made by including previously unaccounted types of sources such as flaring of gas associated with oil production, and wick lamps. These emission data were used for present-day reference simulations with four advanced Earth system models (ESMs) and six chemistry transport models (CTMs). The model simulations were compared with a variety of ground-based and satellite observational data sets from Asia, Europe and the Arctic. It was found that the models still underestimate the measured seasonality of aerosols in the Arctic but to a lesser extent than in previous studies. Problems likely related to the emissions were identified for northern Russia and India, in particular. To estimate the climate impacts of SLCPs, ECLIPSE followed two paths of research: the first path calculated radiative forcing (RF) values for a large matrix of SLCP species emissions, for different seasons and regions independently. Based on these RF calculations, the Global Temperature change Potential metric for a time horizon of 20 years (GTP20) was calculated for each SLCP emission type. This climate metric was then used in an integrated assessment model to identify all emission mitigation measures with a beneficial air quality and short-term (20-year) climate impact. These measures together defined a SLCP mitigation (MIT) scenario. Compared to CLE, the MIT scenario would reduce global methane (CH4) and black carbon (BC) emissions by about 50 and 80 \%, respectively. For CH4, measures on shale gas production, waste management and coal mines were most important. For non-CH4 SLCPs, elimination of high-emitting vehicles and wick lamps, as well as reducing emissions from gas flaring, coal and biomass stoves, agricultural waste, solvents and diesel engines were most important. These measures lead to large reductions in calculated surface concentrations of ozone and particulate matter. We estimate that in the EU, the loss of statistical life expectancy due to air pollution was 7.5 months in 2010, which will be reduced to 5.2 months by 2030 in the CLE scenario. The MIT scenario would reduce this value by another 0.9 to 4.3 months. Substantially larger reductions due to the mitigation are found for China (1.8 months) and India (11–12 months). The climate metrics cannot fully quantify the climate response. Therefore, a second research path was taken. Transient climate ensemble simulations with the four ESMs were run for the CLE and MIT scenarios, to determine the climate impacts of the mitigation. In these simulations, the CLE scenario resulted in a surface temperature increase of 0.70 ± 0.14 K between the years 2006 and 2050. For the decade 2041–2050, the warming was reduced by 0.22 ± 0.07 K in the MIT scenario, and this result was in almost exact agreement with the response calculated based on the emission metrics (reduced warming of 0.22 ± 0.09 K). The metrics calculations suggest that non-CH4 SLCPs contribute {\textasciitilde} 22 \% to this response and CH4 78 \%. This could not be fully confirmed by the transient simulations, which attributed about 90 \% of the temperature response to CH4 reductions. Attribution of the observed temperature response to non-CH4 SLCP emission reductions and BC specifically is hampered in the transient simulations by small forcing and co-emitted species of the emission basket chosen. Nevertheless, an important conclusion is that our mitigation basket as a whole would lead to clear benefits for both air quality and climate. The climate response from BC reductions in our study is smaller than reported previously, possibly because our study is one of the first to use fully coupled climate models, where unforced variability and sea ice responses cause relatively strong temperature fluctuations that may counteract (and, thus, mask) the impacts of small emission reductions. The temperature responses to the mitigation were generally stronger over the continents than over the oceans, and with a warming reduction of 0.44 K (0.39–0.49) K the largest over the Arctic. Our calculations suggest particularly beneficial climate responses in southern Europe, where surface warming was reduced by about 0.3 K and precipitation rates were increased by about 15 (6–21) mm yr−1 (more than 4 \% of total precipitation) from spring to autumn. Thus, the mitigation could help to alleviate expected future drought and water shortages in the Mediterranean area. We also report other important results of the ECLIPSE project.},

The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Fuchs’ theory, as corrected by Hoppel and Frick, is widely used to compute flux coefficients of ions to aerosol particles and the resultant charge distribution. We have identified approximations made in previous works that limit the theory's accuracy. Hoppel and Frick used two characteristic speeds or kinetic energies to calculate the flux coefficients of ions to aerosol particles in lieu of an average of the flux coefficients over the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of ion speeds. In the present work, we show that this approximation artificially reduces the number of multiply charged particles. Ion capture may be enhanced by three-body trapping, a process wherein an ion has a collision with a neutral gas molecule and loses sufficient kinetic energy to be captured by the particle. The gas kinetic theory approach to three-body trapping has been refined to better account for the collision between the ion and a neutral gas molecule within the potential presented by the particle. Approximations to the calculation of energy losses and the probability of ion capture have been relaxed. The possibility that an image charge may be induced on the ion as well as on the particle is allowed. While the previous work was limited to electrically conductive particles, both the ion and the particle are allowed to have any dielectric constant in the present work, and the finite size of the ions is taken into account when calculating minimum capture radii for the ion–particle interactions. The resulting ion flux coefficients differ from previous results both in the low nanometer regime and in the continuum regime. We explore the influence of key parameters on the charge distribution, including dielectric constant, temperature, and pressure, to understand how operating conditions may affect the interpretation of differential mobility analyzer measurements of particle size distributions. Finally, an empirical expression for the new charge distribution is given to facilitate rapid calculations. © 2013 American Association for Aerosol Research},

A NAWH is predicted by climate models during the 21st century, and its pattern is already emerging in observations. Despite the known key role of the North Atlantic surface temperatures in setting the Northern Hemisphere climate, the mechanisms behind the NAWH are still not fully understood. Using state‐of‐the‐art climate models, we show that anthropogenic aerosol forcing opposes the formation of the NAWH (by leading to a local warming) and delays its emergence by about 30 years. In agreement with previous studies, we also demonstrate that the relative warming of the North Atlantic under aerosol forcing is due to changes in ocean heat fluxes, rather than air‐sea fluxes. These results suggest that the predicted reduction in aerosol forcing during the 21st century may accelerate the formation of the NAWH.},

In particular the radiative impact of cloud spatial organization is poorly understood. This work presents the first unsupervised neural network model which autonomously discovers cloud organization regimes in satellite images. Trained on 10,000 GOES‐16 satellite images (tropical Atlantic and boreal winter) the regimes found are shown to exist in a hierarchy of organizational scales, with sub‐clusters having distinct radiative properties. The model requires no time‐consuming and subjective hand‐labeled data based on predefined structures allowing for objective study of very large data sets. The model enables the study of environmental conditions in different organizational regimes and in transitions between regimes and objective comparisons of model behavior with observations through cloud structures emerging in both. These abilities enable the discovery of previously unknown physical relationships in cloud processes, enabling better representation of clouds in weather and climate simulations. A neural network can learn without supervision to discover similar cloud structures in satellite imagery The groups of cloud structures produced by the neural network have distinct radiative properties and thus distinct climatic impacts The neural network learns to represent similarity between cloud structures allowing for the study of the temporal evolution between regimes},

Scattering calculated from aerosol size distributions measured with an optical particle counter agreed well with simultaneous nephelometer measurements. We periodically heated sample air to evaporate sulfates and organic material. The change in volume upon heating agreed well with simultaneous measurements of aerosol composition. This volatile material was distributed on dust in rough proportion to surface area. Here we use the particle size and composition data to improve estimates of scattering at ambient humidity and to examine the effects of mixing on the optical properties of both pollution and dust aerosols. The presence of dust results in uptake of soluble and condensible species onto its surface and thereby reduces the mass scattering efficiency of the pollution aerosol by 50\% and suppresses the change in scattering due to relative humidity (f(RH)) by up to 35\%.},

	abstract = {Clouds can be classified into regimes based on their appearance or meteorological controlling factors. The cloud appearance regimes inherently include adjustments to aerosol effects, such as transitions between closed and open cells. Therefore, calculating cloud susceptibilities to aerosols for each cloud‐appearance regime individually and then aggregating them excludes much of the cloud adjustment component of the susceptibilities. In contrast, aggregating susceptibilities over regimes defined by cloud‐controlling factors includes the full effects of cloud adjustments. Here we compared the susceptibilities of the two kinds of cloud regimes and demonstrated this effect. Overall, increasing cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) consistently correlates to weaker precipitation, higher cloud fraction (CF), and reduced liquid water path, regardless of how the regime is defined. However, their susceptibilities to Nd aggregated over cloud‐appearance regimes are significantly lower than those aggregated over cloud‐controlling factors regimes, with lower‐tropospheric stability (LTS) serving as an example to define cloud‐controlling factors regimes. This underestimation is more pronounced for CF susceptibility, where the susceptibility for cloud appearance regimes is only 1/4 of the susceptibility for cloud controlling regimes. These findings imply that relying solely on cloud‐appearance regimes may underestimate the effective radiative forcing produced by cloud adjustment (ERFaci). Nevertheless, the substantial variability in the magnitude of cloud adjustment across appearance regimes at similar LTS also suggests that a single cloud‐controlling factor is not sufficient to fully separate cloud regimes to quantify cloud adjustment. Therefore, identifying a comprehensive set of cloud‐controlling factors is essential for accurately quantifying cloud adjustments in future studies. Understanding the impact of aerosols on marine low clouds is vital for accurately predicting changes in Earth's climate. Their interactions, known as aerosol‐cloud interactions (ACI), introduce significant uncertainty into our estimates of how much human activities contribute to climate change. Clouds exhibit varying responses to changes in cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), a proxy for aerosols, depending on specific cloud regimes representing distinct atmospheric conditions. However, the definition of cloud regime is often vague, with some defined based on the appearance of clouds and others on their meteorological controlling factors. In our study, we compared the sensitivity of cloud properties to Nd between these two different definitions of cloud regimes. We found that cloud susceptibilities to Nd aggregated over cloud‐appearance regimes are notably lower than those aggregated over cloud‐controlling factors regimes. Cloud fraction susceptibility to Nd aggregated over cloud appearance regimes is only one‐fourth of that over cloud controlling regimes. These results suggest that quantifying cloud adjustment to Nd simply within cloud appearance regimes will likely underestimate the effective radiative forcing of ACI (ERFaci) without accounting for the effect of aerosols on cloud‐appearance regimes. Cloud‐appearance regimes are unsuitable for quantifying cloud adjustment to cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) The susceptibility of cloud fraction to Nd for cloud‐appearance regimes is only 1/4 of that based on cloud‐controlling regimes Quantifying cloud adjustment simply within cloud‐appearance regimes is likely to underestimate ERFaci Cloud‐appearance regimes are unsuitable for quantifying cloud adjustment to cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) The susceptibility of cloud fraction to Nd for cloud‐appearance regimes is only 1/4 of that based on cloud‐controlling regimes Quantifying cloud adjustment simply within cloud‐appearance regimes is likely to underestimate ERFaci},

	abstract = {Climate models exhibit high sensitivity in some respects, such as for differences in predicted precipitation changes under global warming. Despite successful large-scale simulations, regional climatology features prove difficult to constrain toward observations, with challenges including high-dimensionality, computationally expensive simulations, and ambiguity in the choice of objective function. In an atmospheric General Circulation Model forced by observed sea surface temperature or coupled to a mixed-layer ocean, many climatic variables yield rms-error objective functions that vary smoothly through the feasible parameter range. This smoothness occurs despite nonlinearity strong enough to reverse the curvature of the objective function in some parameters, and to imply limitations on multimodel ensemble means as an estimator of global warming precipitation changes. Low-order polynomial fits to the model output spatial fields as a function of parameter (quadratic in model field, fourth-order in objective function) yield surprisingly successful metamodels for many quantities and facilitate a multiobjective optimization approach. Tradeoffs arise as optima for different variables occur at different parameter values, but with agreement in certain directions. Optima often occur at the limit of the feasible parameter range, identifying key parameterization aspects warranting attention—here the interaction of convection with free tropospheric water vapor. Analytic results for spatial fields of leading contributions to the optimization help to visualize tradeoffs at a regional level, e.g., how mismatches between sensitivity and error spatial fields yield regional error under minimization of global objective functions. The approach is sufficiently simple to guide parameter choices and to aid intercomparison of sensitivity properties among climate models.},

We show that with high probability the KL divergence can be made arbitrarily small by growing \$M\$ more slowly than \$N\$.

The Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) is one such high‐ECS model. Here we perform paleoclimate simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using CESM2 to examine whether its high ECS is realistic. We find that the simulated LGM global mean temperature decrease exceeds 11°C, greater than both the cooling estimated from proxies and simulated by an earlier model version (CESM1). The large LGM cooling in CESM2 is attributed to a strong shortwave cloud feedback in the newest atmosphere model. Our results indicate that the high ECS of CESM2 is incompatible with LGM constraints and that the projected future warming in CESM2, and models with a similarly high ECS, is thus likely too large. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is one of the most important metrics in climate science. It measures the amount of global warming over hundreds of years after a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. An ECS range of 1.5°C–4.5°C has been consistently supported by climate models over the past 40 years. However, this has changed in the latest generation of climate models with eight (as of this writing) showing an ECS {\textgreater} 5°C. Such a high ECS implies that future warming will be much greater than previously thought for the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions, making it more challenging for human and natural systems to adapt. This study examines whether the ECS in one “high‐ECS” model—Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2)—is realistic. Our approach is to perform a paleoclimate simulation of the culmination of the last glacial period, which was colder and had a lower atmospheric CO2 level than today. We find that the magnitude of cooling in the CESM2 simulation is much larger than supported by the observational evidence, indicating the model's ECS is too large. We further find that the high ECS of CESM2 is caused by the treatment of clouds in the model. Community Earth System Model version 2 simulates an Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) global temperature at least 5°C colder than the proxy estimate, indicating its equilibrium climate sensitivity is too high The large LGM cooling is caused by a strong shortwave cloud feedback in the new atmosphere model The shortwave cloud feedback in LGM simulations is connected to that in abrupt 4×CO2 simulations from the present‐day climate Community Earth System Model version 2 simulates an Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) global temperature at least 5°C colder than the proxy estimate, indicating its equilibrium climate sensitivity is too high The large LGM cooling is caused by a strong shortwave cloud feedback in the new atmosphere model The shortwave cloud feedback in LGM simulations is connected to that in abrupt 4×CO2 simulations from the present‐day climate},

	abstract = {Abstract Single-forcing large ensembles are a relatively new tool for quantifying the contributions of different anthropogenic and natural forcings to the historical and future projected evolution of the climate system. This study introduces a new single-forcing large ensemble with the Community Earth System Model, version 2 (CESM2), which can be used to separate the influences of greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols, biomass burning aerosols, and all remaining forcings on the evolution of the Earth system from 1850 to 2050. Here, the forced responses of global near-surface temperature and associated drivers are examined in CESM2 and compared with those in a single-forcing large ensemble with CESM2’s predecessor, CESM1. The experimental design, the imposed forcing, and the model physics all differ between the CESM1 and CESM2 ensembles. In CESM1, an “all-but-one” approach was used whereby everything except the forcing of interest is time evolving, while in CESM2 an “only” approach is used, whereby only the forcing of interest is time evolving. This experimental design choice is shown to matter considerably for anthropogenic aerosol-forced change in CESM2, due to state dependence of cryospheric albedo feedbacks and nonlinearity in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) response to forcing. This impact of experimental design is, however, strongly dependent on the model physics and/or the imposed forcing, as the same sensitivity to experimental design is not found in CESM1, which appears to be an inherently less nonlinear model in both its AMOC behavior and cryospheric feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Land models are essential tools for understanding and predicting terrestrial processes and climate–carbon feedbacks in the Earth system, but uncertainties in their future projections are poorly understood. Improvements in physical process realism and the representation of human influence arguably make models more comparable to reality but also increase the degrees of freedom in model configuration, leading to increased parametric uncertainty in projections. In this work we design and implement a machine learning approach to globally calibrate a subset of the parameters of the Community Land Model, version 5 (CLM5) to observations of carbon and water fluxes. We focus on parameters controlling biophysical features such as surface energy balance, hydrology, and carbon uptake. We first use parameter sensitivity simulations and a combination of objective metrics including ranked global mean sensitivity to multiple output variables and non-overlapping spatial pattern responses between parameters to narrow the parameter space and determine a subset of important CLM5 biophysical parameters for further analysis. Using a perturbed parameter ensemble, we then train a series of artificial feed-forward neural networks to emulate CLM5 output given parameter values as input. We use annual mean globally aggregated spatial variability in carbon and water fluxes as our emulation and calibration targets. Validation and out-of-sample tests are used to assess the predictive skill of the networks, and we utilize permutation feature importance and partial dependence methods to better interpret the results. The trained networks are then used to estimate global optimal parameter values with greater computational efficiency than achieved by hand tuning efforts and increased spatial scale relative to previous studies optimizing at a single site. By developing this methodology, our framework can help quantify the contribution of parameter uncertainty to overall uncertainty in land model projections.},

While there are a number of tools available for working with climate model data, the large diversity of sources (and formats) of remote sensing and in situ measurements necessitated a novel software solution. Developed by a professional software company, CIS supports a large number of gridded and ungridded data sources "out-of-the-box", including climate model output in NetCDF or the UK Met Office pp file format, CloudSat, CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization), MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), Cloud and Aerosol CCI (Climate Change Initiative) level 2 satellite data and a number of in situ aircraft and ground station data sets. The open-source architecture also supports user-defined plugins to allow many other sources to be easily added. Many of the key operations required when comparing heterogenous data sets are provided by CIS, including subsetting, aggregating, collocating and plotting the data. Output data are written to CF-compliant NetCDF files to ensure interoperability with other tools and systems. The latest documentation, including a user manual and installation instructions, can be found on our website (http://cistools.net). Here, we describe the need which this tool fulfils, followed by descriptions of its main functionality (as at version 1.4.0) and plugin architecture which make it unique in the field.},

These models are computationally demanding, placing practical constraints on their use in these applications, especially for long, climate‐relevant simulations. In many situations, the horizontal‐mean atmospheric structure evolves slowly compared to the turnover time of the most energetic turbulent eddies. We develop a simple scheme to reduce this time scale separation to accelerate the evolution of the mean state. Using this approach we are able to accelerate the model evolution by a factor of 2–16 or more in idealized stratocumulus, shallow and deep cumulus convection without substantial loss of accuracy in simulating mean cloud statistics and their sensitivity to climate change perturbations. As a culminating test, we apply this technique to accelerate the embedded CRMs in the Superparameterized Community Atmosphere Model by a factor of 2, thereby showing that the method is robust and stable to realistic perturbations across spatial and temporal scales typical in a GCM. We introduce an acceleration technique for CRMs, LES, and superparameterized GCMs We achieve substantial speedup (2–16X) with little impact on cloud condensate for a range of cases We present applications to superparameterization and LES cloud‐climate feedback studies},

Anthropogenic direct radiative forcing is assessed using new observation‐based aerosol radiative kernels. Anthropogenic aerosols are found to account for 21\% of the global radiative effect, or −0.50 ± 0.3 W/m2, mainly from sulfate pollution (−0.54 W/m2) partially offset by absorption from smoke (0.03 W/m2). Uncertainty estimates effectively rule out the possibility that anthropogenic aerosols warm the planet, although strong positive forcing is observed locally where anthropogenic aerosols reside above clouds and bright surfaces. A‐Train observations show that aerosols exert a global radiative effect of −2.40 W/m2 Anthropogenic aerosol is found to account for 21\% of the total effect, or −0.50 W/m2 Uncertainty analyses indicate that anthropogenic aerosols exert net cooling globally},

In addition, an evaluation of a pair of CESM2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low‐top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high‐top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low‐latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation; better El Niño‐Southern Oscillation‐related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low‐ and high‐top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. CESM2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is an open‐source, comprehensive model used in simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climates. The newest version, CESM2, has many new technical and scientific capabilities ranging from a more realistic representation of Greenland's evolving ice sheet, to the ability to model in detail how crops interact with the larger Earth system, to improved representation of clouds and rain, and to the addition of wind‐driven waves on the model's ocean surface. The data sets from a large set of simulations that include integrations for the preindustrial conditions (1850s) and for the 1850‐2014 historical period are available to the community, representing CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).

The polluted clouds were identified in pixels with elevated 2.1-μm reflectivities and 3.7-μm radiances when compared with nearby pixels that contained unpolluted clouds. An automated routine was developed to identify which of the pixels contained clouds polluted by underlying ships and then to select unpolluted control pixels on both sides of the ship track as near as was feasible to the polluted clouds, often with a separation of as little as 1 pixel. While no requirements were placed on the cloud cover fraction within the selected pixels, to facilitate comparisons with an earlier study based on 1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery, the results presented here are restricted to 20-pixel segments along the ship tracks in which all of the pixels identified as polluted and all of the pixels selected as controls on both sides of the tracks were found to be overcast. The pollution caused about a 20\% reduction in droplet radius in both the MODIS and the AVHRR observations. In the MODIS observations, the increase in optical depth was about 15\% and statistically significant at a confidence level greater than 99.5\%. These changes were much larger than the 2\% and statistically negligible increases found for the AVHRR observations. Like the AVHRR observations, the MODIS observations indicated that the majority of clouds (60\%) lost liquid water when polluted, but consistent with the different outcomes for the optical depths, the losses for the MODIS observations were about half the nearly 20\% loss found in the AVHRR observations. Cloud altitudes were unaffected by the pollution for both the MODIS and the AVHRR observations. For both morning and afternoon clouds, those with the largest increases in albedo in response to the pollution also showed the largest increases in cloud liquid water amount. The changes in droplet radii and liquid water amounts retrieved using the MODIS observations suggested that droplet growth was suppressed in the polluted clouds and that the rate of growth from cloud base to cloud top was also reduced when compared with nearby unpolluted clouds.},

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program \#5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound, for each region and sector, is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone, carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However, stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however, the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured. The simulated sulfate and black carbon deposition over Greenland is in very good agreement with the ice-core observations spanning the simulation period. Finally, aerosol optical depth and additional aerosol diagnostics are shown to be in good agreement with previously published estimates and observations.},

	abstract = {This thesis develops a method for automatically constructing, visualizing and describing a large class of models, useful for forecasting and finding structure in domains such as time series, geological formations, and physical dynamics. These models, based on Gaussian processes, can capture many types of statistical structure, such as periodicity, changepoints, additivity, and symmetries. Such structure can be encoded through kernels, which have historically been hand-chosen by experts. We show how to automate this task, creating a system that explores an open-ended space of models and reports the structures discovered.
To automatically construct Gaussian process models, we search over sums and products of kernels, maximizing the approximate marginal likelihood. We show how any model in this class can be automatically decomposed into qualitatively different parts,
and how each component can be visualized and described through text. We combine these results into a procedure that, given a dataset, automatically constructs a model along with a detailed report containing plots and generated text that illustrate the structure discovered in the data.
The introductory chapters contain a tutorial showing how to express many types of structure through kernels, and how adding and multiplying different kernels combines their properties. Examples also show how symmetric kernels can produce priors over topological manifolds such as cylinders, toruses, and Möbius strips, as well as their higher-dimensional generalizations.
This thesis also explores several extensions to Gaussian process models. First, building on existing work that relates Gaussian processes and neural nets, we analyze natural extensions of these models to deep kernels and deep Gaussian processes. Second, we examine additive Gaussian processes, showing their relation to the regularization method of dropout. Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet process to produce the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering model having nonparametric cluster shapes, and a corresponding latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable parametric form.},

	abstract = {During austral winter, a compact low cloud deck over the South Atlantic contrasts with clear sky over southern Africa, where forest fires triggered by dry conditions emit large amounts of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) in the free troposphere. Most of the BBA burden crosses the South Atlantic embedded in the tropical easterly flow. However, midlatitude synoptic disturbances can deflect part of the aerosol from the main transport path towards southern extratropics. In this study, the first objective classification of the synoptic variability controlling the spatial distribution of BBA in southern Africa and the South Atlantic during austral winter (August to October) is presented. By analysing atmospheric circulation data from reanalysis products, a six-class weather regime (WR) classification of the region is constructed. The classification reveals that the synoptic variability is composed of four WRs, representing disturbances travelling at midlatitudes, and two WRs accounting for pressure anomalies in the South Atlantic. The WR classification is then successfully used to characterise the aerosol spatial distribution in the region in the period 2003–2017, in both reanalysis products and station data. Results show that the BBA transport towards southern extratropics is controlled by weather regimes associated with midlatitude synoptic disturbances. In particular, depending on the relative position of the pressure anomalies along the midlatitude westerly flow, the BBA transport is deflected from the main tropical route towards southern Africa or the South Atlantic. Moreover, the WRs accounting for midlatitude disturbances show organised transition sequences, which allow one to illustrate the evolution of the BBA northerly transport across the region in the context of a wave pattern. The skill in characterising the BBA transport shown by the WR classification indicates the potential for using it as a diagnostic/predictive tool for the aerosol dynamics, which is a key component for the full understanding and modelling of the complex radiation–aerosol–cloud interactions controlling the atmospheric radiative budget in the region.},

	abstract = {In the most advanced aerosol-climate models it is common to represent the aerosol particle size distribution in terms of several log-normal modes. This approach, motivated by computational efficiency, makes assumptions about the shape of the particle distribution that may not always capture the properties of global aerosol. Here, a global modal aerosol microphysics module (GLOMAP-mode) is evaluated and improved by comparing against a sectional version (GLOMAP-bin) and observations in the same 3-D global offline chemistry transport model. With both schemes, the model captures the main features of the global particle size distribution, with sub-micron aerosol approximately unimodal in continental regions and bi-modal in marine regions. Initial bin-mode comparisons showed that the current values for two size distribution parameter settings in the modal scheme (mode widths and inter-modal separation sizes) resulted in clear biases compared to the sectional scheme. By adjusting these parameters in the modal scheme, much better agreement is achieved against the bin scheme and observations. Annual mean surface-level mass of sulphate, sea-salt, black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) are within 25\% in the two schemes in nearly all regions. Surface level concentrations of condensation nuclei (CN), cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), surface area density and condensation sink also compare within 25\% in most regions. However, marine CCN concentrations between 30° N and 30° S are systematically 25–60\% higher in the modal model, which we attribute to differences in size-resolved particle growth or cloud-processing. Larger differences also exist in regions or seasons dominated by biomass burning and in free-troposphere and high-latitude regions. Indeed, in the free-troposphere, GLOMAP-mode BC is a factor 2–4 higher than GLOMAP-bin, likely due to differences in size-resolved scavenging. Nevertheless, in most parts of the atmosphere, we conclude that bin-mode differences are much less than model-observation differences, although some processes are missing in these runs which may pose a bigger challenge to modal schemes (e.g., boundary layer nucleation and ultra-fine sea-spray). The findings here underline the need for a spectrum of complexity in global models, with size-resolved aerosol properties predicted by modal schemes needing to be continually benchmarked and improved against freely evolving sectional schemes and observations.},

Due to its altitude, this site is suitable for ground-based in-cloud measurements, with a high cloud frequency of 40\%. Dry total and interstitial aerosol size distributions [18 nm {\textless}particle diameter (Dp){\textless}800 nm] were determined with a time resolution of 6 min. A forward scattering spectrometer probe (FSSP-100) measured the cloud droplet size distribution, and a particle volume monitor (PVM-100) was used to measure liquid water content (LWC). In addition, the aerosol chemical composition (major soluble ions) was determined in two size classes (total and sub-micron particles). Agreement within the range of measurement uncertainties was observed between the droplet number concentrations derived from the aerosol size distribution measurements (total minus interstitial) and those measured by the FSSP. The observed particle diameter at 50\% activation (D50) was typically around 100 nm for LWC  0.15 g m−3. Below this value, D50 increased with decreasing LWC. A dependence of D50 on the accumulation mode (Dp{\textgreater}100 nm) number concentration (Ntot,Dp{\textgreater}100) was only found for concentrations less than 100 cm−3. For higher values of Ntot,Dp{\textgreater}100 the D50 remained constant. Furthermore, a decrease of the effective radius of cloud droplets (Reff) with increasing Ntot,Dp{\textgreater}100 was observed, providing experimental evidence for the microphysical relation predicted by the Twomey effect. A modified Köhler model was used to quantify the critical supersaturation for the aerosol observed at the JFJ. Ambient supersaturations were determined from the derived supersaturation curve and the calculated D50. As an example, a critical supersaturation of 0.2\% was found for 100 nm particles.},

In comparison, graph neural networks (GNNs) are capable of modeling large-scale spatial dependencies and are more interpretable due to the explicit modeling of information flow through edge connections. We propose the first application of graph neural networks to seasonal forecasting. We design a novel graph connectivity learning module that enables our GNN model to learn large-scale spatial interactions jointly with the actual ENSO forecasting task. Our model, {\textbackslash}graphino, outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning-based models for forecasts up to six months ahead.

These drivers include non-CO2 greenhouse gases, short-lived climate forcers such as aerosol and ozone precursors, and changes in the land surface. Smart targeting of these non-CO2 drivers, in combination with a serious and sustained attempt to reach net-zero CO2 emissions, could result in substantial avoided climate damages. Evaluating the climate effect of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions is not yet possible in most state-of-the-art climate models, though exciting developments are occurring. Simpler tools including reduced-complexity climate models and climate metrics are currently used to evaluate the climate impacts of non-CO2 drivers.

For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.},

We investigate the mean and extreme temperature response to regional changes in aerosol emissions using three coupled chemistry–climate models: NOAA GFDL CM3, NCAR CESM1, and NASA GISS-E2. Our approach contrasts a long present-day control simulation from each model (up to 400 years with perpetual year 2000 or 2005 emissions) with 14 individual aerosol emissions perturbation simulations (160–240 years each). We perturb emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and/or carbonaceous aerosol within six world regions and assess the statistical significance of mean and extreme temperature responses relative to internal variability determined by the control simulation and across the models. In all models, the global mean surface temperature response (perturbation minus control) to SO2 and/or carbonaceous aerosol is mostly positive (warming) and statistically significant and ranges from +0.17 K (Europe SO2) to -0.06 K (US BC). The warming response to SO2 reductions is strongest in the US and Europe perturbation simulations, both globally and regionally, with Arctic warming up to 1 K due to a removal of European anthropogenic SO2 emissions alone; however, even emissions from regions remote to the Arctic, such as SO2 from India, significantly warm the Arctic by up to 0.5 K. Arctic warming is the most robust response across each model and several aerosol emissions perturbations. The temperature response in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes is most sensitive to emissions perturbations within that region. In the tropics, however, the temperature response to emissions perturbations is roughly the same in magnitude as emissions perturbations either within or outside of the tropics. We find that climate sensitivity to regional aerosol perturbations ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 K (Wm-2)-1 depending on the region and aerosol composition and is larger than the climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 in two of three models. We update previous estimates of regional temperature potential (RTP), a metric for estimating the regional temperature responses to a regional emissions perturbation that can facilitate assessment of climate impacts with integrated assessment models without requiring computationally demanding coupled climate model simulations. These calculations indicate a robust regional response to aerosol forcing within the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes, regardless of where the aerosol forcing is located longitudinally. We show that regional aerosol perturbations can significantly increase extreme temperatures on the regional scale. Except in the Arctic in the summer, extreme temperature responses largely mirror mean temperature responses to regional aerosol perturbations through a shift of the temperature distributions and are mostly dominated by local rather than remote aerosol forcing.},

In this part, the general analytical solution of the system is given and two idealized climate change scenarios, one with a step forcing and one with a linear forcing, are discussed. These solutions give a didactic description of the contributions from the equilibrium response and of the fast and slow transient responses during a climate transition. Based on these analytical solutions, a simple and physically based procedure to calibrate the two-layer model parameters using an AOGCM step-forcing experiment is introduced. Using this procedure, the global thermal properties of 16 AOGCMs participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are determined. It is shown that, for a given AOGCM, the EBM tuned with only the abrupt 4×CO2 experiment is able to reproduce with a very good accuracy the temperature evolution in both a step-forcing and a linear-forcing experiment. The role of the upper-ocean and deep-ocean heat uptakes in the fast and slow responses is also discussed. One of the main weaknesses of the simple EBM discussed in this part is its ability to represent the evolution of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance in the transient regime. This issue is addressed in Part II by taking into account the efficacy factor of deep-ocean heat uptake.},

Also, the surface equilibrium temperature of the former is almost twice as sensitive to change of various factors such as solar constant, CO2 content, O3 content, and cloudiness, than that of the latter, due to the adjustment of water vapor content to the temperature variation of the atmosphere. According to our estimate, a doubling of the CO2 content in the atmosphere has the effect of raising the temperature of the atmosphere (whose relative humidity is fixed) by about 2C.

	abstract = {The parameterization of moist convection contributes to uncertainty in climate modeling and numerical weather prediction. Machine learning (ML) can be used to learn new parameterizations directly from high‐resolution model output, but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here we focus on these issues using idealized tests in which an ML‐based parameterization is trained on output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures conservation of energy and nonnegativity of surface precipitation. The GCM with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction between convection and the large‐scale environment. Small‐scale features such as clouds are typically represented in climate models by simplified physical models, and these simplified models introduce errors and uncertainties. A promising alternative approach is to use machine learning to train a statistical model to represent small‐scale processes based on output from expensive physics‐based models that better represent the small‐scale processes. Here we use idealized tests to explore the implications of incorporating a machine‐learning model of atmospheric convection in a climate model. We find that such an approach can give accurate simulations of mean climate and heavy rainfall events. The machine‐learning model does not work well for global warming if it is only trained on the current climate. However, it does work well for global warming if trained on both the current and warmer climates, and it works surprisingly well if only trained on the warmer climate. We also show that the machine‐learning model can be used to better understand the underlying physical processes. Random‐forest parameterization of convection gives accurate GCM simulations of climate and precipitation extremes in idealized tests Climate change captured when trained on control and warm climate, or only on warm climate, but not when trained only on control climate Machine‐learning parameterizations can also be interrogated to generate diagnostics of interaction of convection with the environment},

In 2020, new shipping regulations mandated an ∼80\% reduction in the allowed fuel sulfur content. Recent observations indicate that visible ship tracks have decreased. Model simulations indicate that since 2020 shipping regulations have induced a net radiative forcing of +0.12 Wm−2. Analysis of recent temperature anomalies indicates Northern Hemisphere surface temperature anomalies in 2022–2023 are correlated with observed cloud radiative forcing and the cloud radiative forcing is spatially correlated with the simulated radiative forcing from the 2020 shipping emission changes. Shipping emissions changes could be accelerating global warming. To better constrain these estimates, better access to ship position data and understanding of ship aerosol emissions are needed. Understanding the risks and benefits of emissions reductions and the difficultly in robust attribution highlights the large uncertainty in attributing proposed deliberate climate intervention. Ships have a unique climate effect due to brightening of low marine clouds, resulting in visible “ship tracks”. These ship tracks are due to clouds interacting with ship emissions, particularly sulfur. Recently, regulations have drastically reduced allowable ship sulfur emissions. This has resulted in a decrease in observable ship tracks. Modeling and observations indicate that the reduction in ship sulfur emissions could have slightly warmed the planet starting in 2020. These changes are remarkably co‐incident with observed patterns of cloud changes and may have accelerated global warming.

	abstract = {Satellite images show solid marine stratocumulus cloud decks (Sc) that break up over the remote oceans. The Sc breakup is initiated by precipitation and is accompanied by a strong reduction in the cloud radiative effect. Aerosol has been shown to delay the Sc breakup by postponing the onset of precipitation, however its climatic effect is uncertain. Here we introduce a new approach that allows us to re‐cast currently observed cloud cover and albedo to their counterfactual cleaner world, enabling the first estimate of the radiative effect due to delayed cloud breakup. Using simple radiative approximation, the radiative forcing with respect to pre‐industrial times due to delayed Sc breakup is −0.39 W m−2. The radiative effect changes nearly linearly with aerosol due to the droplet concentration control on the cloud cover, suggesting a potentially accelerated warming if the current trend of reduction in aerosol emissions continues. The response of cloud cover to aerosol is a climatologically important quantity that has been extremely difficult to estimate. The challenge is that one would need to estimate the fractional area that is currently overcast, but which would have been partly overcast in a cleaner atmosphere. Global climate models (GCMs) are one tool to address such a problem. They allow one to change aerosol levels and to evaluate the cloud response. However, representation of warm, low‐level cloud processes, and in particular aerosol‐cloud interactions in GCMs, is inadequate. Here we introduce an observational method that allows us to re‐cast the currently observed cloud cover and albedo of oceanic warm clouds to their counterfactual state in a cleaner world. We find a linear relationship between the cloud radiative effect and droplet concentration. If we continue to experience a decrease in aerosol emissions then we anticipate a reduction in the aerosol‐cloud radiative effect.

Here, we integrate insights from several laboratory measurements and simulate the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the Amazon using a high-resolution chemical transport model. Simulations show that emissions of nitrogen-oxides from Manaus, a city of {\textasciitilde}2 million people, greatly enhance production of biogenic SOA by 60–200\% on average with peak enhancements of 400\%, through the increased oxidation of gas-phase organic carbon emitted by the forests. Simulated enhancements agree with aircraft measurements, and are much larger than those reported over other locations. The implication is that increasing anthropogenic emissions in the future might substantially enhance biogenic SOA in pristine locations like the Amazon. It remains unclear how urban emissions influence the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), including in the Amazon forest. Here, the authors simulate the formation of SOAs in the Amazon using a high-resolution regional chemical transport model. They find that urban emissions of NOx from Manaus enhance the production of biogenic SOA by 60–200\%.},

	abstract = {We analyze the atmospheric processes that explain the large changes in radiative feedbacks between the two latest climate configurations of the Hadley Centre Global Environmental model. We use a large set of atmosphere-only climate change simulations (amip and amip-p4K) to separate the contributions to the differences in feedback parameter from all the atmospheric model developments between the two latest model configurations. We show that the differences are mostly driven by changes in the shortwave cloud radiative feedback in the midlatitudes, mainly over the Southern Ocean. Two new schemes explain most of the differences: the introduction of a new aerosol scheme and the development of a new mixed-phase cloud scheme. Both schemes reduce the strength of the preexisting shortwave negative cloud feedback in the midlatitudes. The new aerosol scheme dampens a strong aerosol-cloud interaction, and it also suppresses a negative clear-sky shortwave feedback. The mixed-phase scheme increases the amount of cloud liquid water path (LWP) in the present day and reduces the increase in LWP with warming. Both changes contribute to reducing the negative radiative feedback of the increase of LWP in the warmer climate. The mixed-phase scheme also enhances a strong, preexisting, positive cloud fraction feedback. We assess the realism of the changes by comparing present-day simulations against observations and discuss avenues that could help constrain the relevant processes.},

	abstract = {The development of parameterizations is a major task in the development of weather and climate models. Model improvement has been slow in the past decades, due to the difficulty of encompassing key physical processes into parameterizations, but also of calibrating or “tuning” the many free parameters involved in their formulation. Machine learning techniques have been recently used for speeding up the development process. While some studies propose to replace parameterizations by data‐driven neural networks, we rather advocate that keeping physical parameterizations is key for the reliability of climate projections. In this paper we propose to harness machine learning to improve physical parameterizations. In particular, we use Gaussian process‐based methods from uncertainty quantification to calibrate the model free parameters at a process level. To achieve this, we focus on the comparison of single‐column simulations and reference large‐eddy simulations over multiple boundary‐layer cases. Our method returns all values of the free parameters consistent with the references and any structural uncertainties, allowing a reduced domain of acceptable values to be considered when tuning the three‐dimensional (3D) global model. This tool allows to disentangle deficiencies due to poor parameter calibration from intrinsic limits rooted in the parameterization formulations. This paper describes the tool and the philosophy of tuning in single‐column mode. Part 2 shows how the results from our process‐based tuning can help in the 3D global model tuning. We apply uncertainty quantification to single‐column model/large‐eddy simulation comparison to calibrate free parameters We revisit model development strategy with an emphasis on processes for model calibration The proposed tuning tool allows to formalize the complementary use of multicases with various metrics We apply uncertainty quantification to single‐column model/large‐eddy simulation comparison to calibrate free parameters We revisit model development strategy with an emphasis on processes for model calibration The proposed tuning tool allows to formalize the complementary use of multicases with various metrics},

Six intensive observation periods of the HOPE (HD(CP)$^{\textrm{2}}$ Observational Prototype Experiment) measurement campaign conducted in spring 2013 and 1 summer day of the same year are simulated. By means of a series of grid-refinement resolution tests (horizontal grid spacing 2.8, 1 km, 500, and 250 m), the applicability of the COSMO model to represent real weather events in the gray zone, i.e., the scale ranging between the mesoscale limit (no turbulence resolved) and the large-eddy simulation limit (energy-containing turbulence resolved), is tested. To the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first non-idealized COSMO simulations in the peer-reviewed literature at the 250–500 m scale. It is found that the kinetic energy spectra derived from model output show the expected −5/3 slope, as well as a dependency on model resolution, and that the effective resolution lies between 6 and 7 times the nominal resolution. Although the representation of a number of processes is enhanced with resolution (e.g., boundary-layer thermals, low-level convergence zones, gravity waves), their influence on the temporal evolution of precipitation is rather weak. However, rain intensities vary with resolution, leading to differences in the total rain amount of up to +48 \%. Furthermore, the location of rain is similar for the springtime cases with moderate and strong synoptic forcing, whereas significant differences are obtained for the summertime case with air mass convection. Domain-averaged liquid water paths and cloud condensate profiles are used to analyze the temporal and spatial variability of the simulated clouds. Finally, probability density functions of convection-related parameters are analyzed to investigate their dependance on model resolution and their impact on cloud formation and subsequent precipitation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Uncertainty in climate feedbacks is the primary source of the spread in projected surface temperature responses to anthropogenic forcing. Cloud feedback persistently appears as the main source of disagreement in future projections while the combined lapse‐rate plus water vapor (LR + WV) feedback is a smaller (30\%), but non‐trivial source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity. Here we attempt to observationally constrain the feedbacks in an effort to reduce their intermodel uncertainties. The observed interannual variation provides a useful constraint on the long‐term cloud feedback, as evidenced by the consistency of global‐mean values and regional contributions to the intermodel spread on both interannual and long‐term timescales. However, interannual variability does not serve to constrain the long‐term LR + WV feedback spread, which we find is dominated by the varying tropical relative humidity (RH) response to interhemispheric warming differences under clear‐sky conditions and the RH‐fixed LR feedback under all‐sky conditions. How much the Earth warms in response to greenhouse gas increases depends on the Earth's efficiency in restoring radiative equilibrium. This efficiency differs significantly among climate models due to differences in feedback processes, particularly the responses of clouds, temperature and water vapor to the initial perturbation. One approach to narrowing the intermodel spread of feedbacks is to only consider models whose observable variability is consistent with available measurements. The magnitude of cloud feedbacks on interannual and long‐term timescales are closely related, which allows us to employ this approach with observational estimates of the interannual cloud feedback to constrain the long‐term cloud feedback. However, this approach does not work for the feedback resulting from changes in the vertical distribution of temperature and water vapor (the combined lapse‐rate plus water vapor feedback). Observed interannual variation provides a useful constraint to narrow the uncertainty in long‐term cloud feedback It is not possible to constrain the long‐term LR + WV feedback uncertainty with available observations of interannual variability Disagreements in the response of tropical relative humidity are responsible for the long‐term clear‐sky LR + WV feedback spread Observed interannual variation provides a useful constraint to narrow the uncertainty in long‐term cloud feedback It is not possible to constrain the long‐term LR + WV feedback uncertainty with available observations of interannual variability Disagreements in the response of tropical relative humidity are responsible for the long‐term clear‐sky LR + WV feedback spread},

Here, we use satellite observations to quantify relationships between sulfate aerosols and low-level clouds while carefully controlling for meteorology. We then combine the relationships with estimates of the change in sulfate concentration since about 1850 to constrain the associated radiative forcing. We estimate that the cloud-mediated radiative forcing from anthropogenic sulfate aerosols is −1.11±0.43 W m−2 over the global ocean (95\% confidence). This constraint implies that ECS is likely between 2.9 and 4.5 K (66\% confidence).

Inference 26 (1990) 131–148) establishes equivalence of the maximin distance design criterion and an entropy criterion motivated by function prediction in a Bayesian setting. The latter criterion has been used by Currin et al. (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 86 (1991) 953–963) to design experiments for which the motivating application is approximation of a complex deterministic computer model. Because computer experiments often have a large number of controlled variables (inputs), maximin designs of moderate size are often concentrated in the corners of the cuboidal design region, i.e. each input is represented at only two levels. Here we will examine some maximin distance designs constructed within the class of Latin hypercube arrangements. The goal of this is to find designs which offer a compromise between the entropy/maximin criterion, and good projective properties in each dimension (as guaranteed by Latin hypercubes). A simulated annealing search algorithm is presented for constructing these designs, and patterns apparent in the optimal designs are discussed.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that atmospheric models with a spectral element grid can benefit from putting physics calculations on a relatively coarse finite volume grid. Here we demonstrate an alternative high‐order, element‐based mapping approach used to implement a quasi‐equal‐area, finite volume physics grid in E3SM. Unlike similar methods, the new method in E3SM requires topology data purely local to each spectral element, which trivially allows for regional mesh refinement. Simulations with physics grids defined by 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 4 divisions of each element are shown to verify that the alternative physics grid does not qualitatively alter the model solution. The model performance is substantially affected by the reduction of physics columns when using the 2 × 2 grid, which can increase the throughput of physics calculations by roughly 60\%–120\% depending on whether the computational resources are configured to maximize throughput or efficiency. A pair of regionally refined cases are also shown to highlight the refinement capability. Most atmospheric models use the same grid for dynamics (e.g., advection) and physics (e.g., clouds). For spectral element models the grid uses irregularly spaced points and the treatment of element edges can lead to grid imprinting bias. Previous studies have shown that using a regularly spaced physics grid in a spectral element model can alleviate the grid imprinting biases. This alternative physics grid can also reduce the computational cost of the model if the physics grid is coarser than the dynamics grid. This study presents a new approach for using a regularly spaced physics grid in a global spectral element model that additionally allows mesh refinement for regionally focused simulations. The use of a relatively coarse physics grid is shown to make the model faster without qualitatively degrading the simulated climate.

The 5×106-year time frame is interesting for a range of paleo-environmental questions, not least because it encompasses the evolution of humans. However, the choice of time frame was primarily pragmatic; tectonic changes can be neglected to first order, so that it is reasonable to consider climate forcing restricted to the Earth's orbital configuration, ice-sheet state, and the concentration of atmosphere CO2. The approach uses the Gaussian process emulation of the singular value decomposition of ensembles of the intermediate-complexity atmosphere–ocean GCM (general circulation model) PLASIM-GENIE. Spatial fields of bioclimatic variables of surface air temperature (warmest and coolest seasons) and precipitation (wettest and driest seasons) are emulated at 1000-year intervals, driven by time series of scalar boundary-condition forcing (CO2, orbit, and ice volume) and assuming the climate is in quasi-equilibrium. Paleoclimate anomalies at climate model resolution are interpolated onto the observed modern climatology to produce a high-resolution spatio-temporal paleoclimate reconstruction of the Pliocene–Pleistocene.},

Approximately 20 000 scenes of size 256 km × 256 km are used in the analysis. It is found that cloud fraction is strongly linked with the LWP variability in the cloudy fraction of the scene. It is shown here that in most cases LWP spatial variance is dominated by horizontal scales of 10–50 km, and increases as the variance-containing scale increases, indicating the importance of organized mesoscale cellular convection (MCC). A neural network technique is used to classify MODIS scenes by the spatial variability type (no MCC, closed MCC, open MCC, cellular but disorganized). It is shown how the different types tend to occupy distinct geographical regions and different physical regimes within the subtropics, although the results suggest considerable overlap of the large-scale meteorological conditions associated with each scene type. It is demonstrated that both the frequency of occurrence, and the variance-containing horizontal scale of the MCC increases as the marine boundary layer (MBL) depth increases. However, for the deepest MBLs, the MCC tends to be replaced by clouds containing cells but lacking organization. In regions where MCC is prevalent, a lack of sensitivity of the MCC type (open or closed) to the large-scale meteorology was found, suggesting a mechanism internal to the MBL may be important in determining MCC type. The results indicate that knowledge of the physics of MCC will be required to completely understand and predict low cloud coverage and variability in the subtropics.},

So far, all studies were based on the same three-step approach: first a training dataset was created from a high-resolution simulation, then a machine learning algorithm was fitted to this dataset, before the trained algorithm was implemented in the ESM. The resulting online simulations were frequently plagued by instabilities and biases. Here, coupled online learning is proposed as a way to combat these issues. Coupled learning can be seen as a second training stage in which the pretrained machine learning parameterization, specifically a neural network, is run in parallel with a high-resolution simulation. The high-resolution simulation is kept in sync with the neural network-driven ESM through constant nudging. This enables the neural network to learn from the tendencies that the high-resolution simulation would produce if it experienced the states the neural network creates. The concept is illustrated using the Lorenz 96 model, where coupled learning is able to recover the “true” parameterizations. Further, detailed algorithms for the implementation of coupled learning in 3D cloud-resolving models and the super parameterization framework are presented. Finally, outstanding challenges and issues not resolved by this approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {Global climate change mitigation is often framed in public discussions as a tradeoff between environmental protection and harm to the economy. However, climate-economy models have consistently calculated that the immediate implementation of greenhouse gas emissions restriction (via e.g. a global carbon price) would be in humanitys best interest on purely economic grounds. Despite this, the implementation of global climate policy has been notoriously difficult to achieve. This evokes an apparent paradox: if the implementation of a global carbon price is not only beneficial to the environment, but is also economically optimal, why has it been so difficult to enact?One potential reason for this difficulty is that economically optimal greenhouse gas emissions restrictions are not economically beneficial for the generation of people that launch them. The purpose of this article is to explore this issue by introducing the concept of the break-even year, which we define as the year when the economically optimal policy begins to produce global mean net economic benefits. We show that in a commonly used climate-economy model (DICE), the break-even year is relatively far into the futurearound 2080 for mitigation policy beginning in the early 2020s. Notably, the break-even year is not sensitive to the uncertain magnitudes of the costs of climate change mitigation policy or the costs of economic damages from climate change. This result makes it explicit and understandable why an economically optimal policy can be difficult to implement in practice.},

This model version differs from the predecessor model (GISS‐E2) chiefly due to parameterization improvements to the atmospheric and ocean model components, while keeping atmospheric resolution the same. Model skill when compared to modern era climatologies is significantly higher than in previous versions. Additionally, updates in forcings have a material impact on the results. In particular, there have been specific improvements in representations of modes of variability (such as the Madden‐Julian Oscillation and other modes in the Pacific) and significant improvements in the simulation of the climate of the Southern Oceans, including sea ice. The effective climate sensitivity to 2 × CO2 is slightly higher than previously at 2.7–3.1°C (depending on version) and is a result of lower CO2 radiative forcing and stronger positive feedbacks. This paper describes the latest iteration of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) climate model, which will be used for understanding historical climate change and to make projections for the future. We compare the model output to a wide range of observations over the recent era (1979–2014) and show that there has been a significant increase in how well the model performs compared to the previous version from 2014, particularly in the Southern Ocean, though some persistent biases remain. The model has a temperature response to the increase of carbon dioxide that is slightly higher than previous versions but is well within the range expected from observational and past climate constraints.

Cloud formation characteristics of the water-soluble organic fraction (WSOC) of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed from the ozonolysis of alkene hydrocarbons (terpinolene, 1-methlycycloheptene and cycloheptene) are studied. Based on size-resolved measurements of CCN activity (of the pure and salted WSOC samples) we estimate the average molar volume and surface tension depression associated with the WSOC using Köhler Theory Analysis (KTA). Consistent with known speciation, the results suggest that the WSOC are composed of low molecular weight species, with an effective molar mass below 200 g mol−1. The water-soluble carbon is also surface-active, depressing surface tension 10–15\% from that of pure water (at CCN-relevant concentrations). The inherent hygroscopicity parameter, κ, of the WSOC ranges between 0.17 and 0.25; if surface tension depression and molar volume effects are considered in κ, a remarkably constant "apparent" hygroscopicity {\textasciitilde}0.3 emerges for all samples considered. This implies that the volume fraction of soluble material in the parent aerosol is the key composition parameter required for prediction of the SOA hygroscopicity, as shifts in molar volume across samples are compensated by changes in surface tension. Finally, using "threshold droplet growth analysis", the water-soluble organics in all samples considered do not affect CCN activation kinetics.},

Our results confirm that cloud and drizzle water content are the most important factors for determining accretion rates. However, for autoconversion, in addition to cloud water content and droplet number concentration, we discovered a key role of drizzle number concentration that is missing in current parameterizations. The robust relation between autoconversion rate and drizzle number concentration is surprising but real, and furthermore supported by theory.

	abstract = {Remote sensing observations, products, and simulations are fundamental sources of information to monitor our planet and its climate variability. Uncovering the main modes of spatial and temporal variability in Earth data is essential to analyze and understand the underlying physical dynamics and processes driving the Earth System. Dimensionality reduction methods can work with spatio-temporal data sets and decompose the information efficiently. Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) in geophysics, has been traditionally used to analyze climatic data. However, when nonlinear feature relations are present, PCA/EOF fails. In this article, we propose a nonlinear PCA method to deal with spatio-temporal Earth system data. The proposed method, called rotated complex kernel PCA (ROCK-PCA for short), works in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to account for nonlinear processes, operates in the complex kernel domain to account for both space and time features, and adds an extra rotation for improved flexibility. The result is an explicitly resolved spatio-temporal decomposition of the Earth data cube. The method is unsupervised and computationally very efficient. We illustrate its ability to uncover spatio-temporal patterns using synthetic experiments and real data. Results of the decomposition of three essential climate variables are shown: satellite-based global gross primary productivity (GPP), soil moisture (SM), and reanalysis sea surface temperature (SST) data. The ROCK-PCA method allows identifying their annual and seasonal oscillations, as well as their nonseasonal trends and spatial variability patterns. The main modes of variability of GPP and SM match expected distributions of land-cover and eco-hydrological zones, respectively; the interannual component of SM is shown to be highly correlated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon; and the SST annual oscillation is perfectly uncoupled in magnitude and phase from the global warming trend and ENSO anomalies, as well as from their mutual interactions.

However, in many cases, models do not match historical observations, particularly on regional scales. If there is a mismatch between modeled and observed climate features, should we necessarily conclude that our models are deficient? Using several illustrative examples, we emphasize that internal variability can easily lead to marked differences between the basic features of the model and observed climate, even when decades of model and observed data are available. This can appear as an apparent failure of models to capture regional trends or changes in global teleconnections, or simulation of extreme events. Despite a large body of literature on the impact of internal variability on climate, this acknowledgment has not yet penetrated many model evaluation activities, particularly for regional climate. We emphasize that using a single or small ensemble of simulations to conclude that a climate model is in error can lead to premature conclusions on model fidelity. A large ensemble of multidecadal simulations is therefore needed to properly sample internal climate variability in order to robustly identify model deficiencies and convincingly demonstrate progress between generations of climate models.},

Techniques for quantifying the uncertainties are described here in terms of a common framework whereby models are used to explore relationships between past climate and climate change and future projections. Model parameters may be varied to produce a range of different simulations of past climate that are then compared with observations using 'metrics'. If the model parameters can be constrained to a tighter range as a result of observational comparisons, projections can also be constrained to a tighter range. The strengths and weaknesses of different implementations are discussed.},

This is an ambitious goal that will require substantial decreases in emission rates of long-lived greenhouse gasses (GHG). This work provides a mathematical framework, based on current state of the art climate models, to calculate the GHG emissions consistent with prescribed GMST pathways that meet the Paris agreement goal. The unique capability of this framework, to start from a GMST timeseries and efficiently calculate the emissions required to meet that temperature pathway, makes it a powerful resource for policymakers. Our results indicate that aerosol emissions play a large role in determining the near-term allowable greenhouse gas emissions that will limit future warming to 2 °C, however in the long term, drastic GHG emissions reductions are required under any reasonable aerosol scenario. With large future aerosol emissions, similar to present day amounts, GHG emissions need to be reduced 8\% by 2040 and 74\% by 2100 to limit warming to 2 °C. Under a more likely low aerosol scenario, GHG emissions need to be reduced 36\% and 80\% by 2040 and 2100, respectively. The Paris agreement Intended Nationally Determined Contributions are insufficient to meet this goal.},

However, the persistent uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing limits our understanding of how much the global mean temperature will respond to near-term reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions. We quantify the model and scenario uncertainty in global mean aerosol radiative forcing up to 2050 using statistical emulation of a perturbed parameter ensemble for emission reduction scenarios consistent with three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. We then use a simple climate model to translate the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing into uncertainty in global mean temperature projections, accounting additionally for the potential correlation of aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. Near-term aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty alone causes an uncertainty window of around 5 years (20342039) on the projected year of exceeding a global temperature rise of 1.5 C above pre-industrial temperatures for a middle of the road emissions scenario (SSP2-RCP4.5). A correlation between aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity would increase the 1.5 C exceedance window by many years. The results highlight the importance of quantifying aerosol radiative forcing and any relationship with climate sensitivity in climate models in order to reduce uncertainty in temperature projections.},

Skilful predictions at time slices from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to interannual (S2I) and seasonal to decadal (S2D) offer information useful for various stakeholders, ranging from agriculture to water resource management to human and infrastructure safety. In this Review, we examine the processes influencing predictability, and discuss estimates of skill across S2S, S2I and S2D timescales. There are encouraging signs that skilful predictions can be made: on S2S timescales, there has been some skill in predicting the Madden–Julian Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation; on S2I, in predicting the El Niño–Southern Oscillation; and on S2D, in predicting ocean and atmosphere variability in the North Atlantic region. However, challenges remain, and future work must prioritize reducing model error, more effectively communicating forecasts to users, and increasing process and mechanistic understanding that could enhance predictive skill and, in turn, confidence. As numerical models progress towards Earth System models, initialized predictions are expanding to include prediction of sea ice, air pollution, and terrestrial and ocean biochemistry that can bring clear benefit to society and various stakeholders. Initialized climate predictions offer distinct benefits for multiple stakeholders. This Review discusses initialized prediction on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to interannual (S2I) and seasonal to decadal (S2D) timescales, highlighting potential for skilful predictions in the years to come.

Explicit tagging of BC source regions without perturbing the emissions provides a physically consistent and computationally efficient approach to establish source‐receptor relationships and transport pathways. Our analysis shows that the contributions of major source regions to the global BC burden are not proportional to the respective emissions due to strong region‐dependent removal rates and lifetimes, while the contributions to BC direct radiative forcing show a near‐linear dependence on their respective contributions to the burden. Arctic BC concentrations, deposition, and source contributions all have strong seasonal variations. Eastern Asia contributes the most to the wintertime Arctic BC burden, but has much less impact on lower‐level concentrations and deposition. Northern Europe emissions are more important to both surface concentration and deposition in winter than in summer. The largest contribution to Arctic BC in the summer is from Northern Asia. Although local emissions contribute less than 10\% to the annual mean BC burden and deposition within the Arctic, the per‐emission efficiency is much higher than for non‐Arctic sources. The interannual variability (1996–2005) due to meteorology is small in annual mean BC burden and radiative forcing but is significant in yearly seasonal means over the Arctic. When a slow aging treatment of BC is introduced, the increase of BC lifetime and burden is source dependent. Global BC forcing‐per‐burden efficiency also increases primarily due to changes in BC vertical distributions. Arctic BC and source contributions have strong seasonal variationsInterannual variability is significant in seasonal means of Arctic BCArctic BC is extremely sensitive to uncertainties in high‐latitude emissions},

The aerosol dampening effects on rainfall has also been suggested as a main driver of mean rainfall shift in India and China. Conflicting views, however, exist on whether aerosols enhance or suppress hazardous extreme heavy rainfall. Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble, here we show that only a subset of models realistically reproduces the late‐20th‐century trend of extreme rainfall for the three major regions in Asia: drying in India and Northern China and wetting in Southern China, all consistent with mean rainfall change. As a common feature, this subset of models includes an explicit treatment of the complex physical processes of aerosol‐cloud interaction (i.e., both cloud‐albedo and cloud‐lifetime effects), while simulation performance deteriorates in models that include only aerosol direct effect or cloud‐albedo effect. The enhanced aerosol pollution during this rapid industrialization era is the leading cause of the spatially heterogeneous extreme rainfall change by dimming surface solar radiation, cooling adjacent ocean water, and weakening moisture transport into the continental region, while GHG warming or natural variability alone cannot explain the observed changes. Our results indicate that the projected intensification of regional extreme rainfall during the early‐to‐mid 21st‐century, in response to the anticipated aerosol reduction, may be underestimated in global climate models without detailed treatment of complex aerosol‐cloud interaction. Over Asia, a robust pattern of drying‐wetting‐drying trend over three most populated regions (India, South China, and North China, respectively) have been observed in the past few decades. Yet the cause of the 30‐year trend is rather unclear, with conflicting arguments on the importance of natural variability, the greenhouse gas, land cover, and aerosols. Most of the previous studies, however, fail to provide a holistic explanation for all three major regions simultaneously. The aerosol‐cloud interaction‐induced oceanic cooling, as we show here, provides a critical piece in reproducing the past trend. Only a fraction of climate models with complex treatment of aerosol‐cloud interaction capture the observed pattern; thus, unconstrained model data set provides biased outlook of extreme rainfall in this region. Drying‐wetting‐drying trend over India, Southern China, and Northern China is observed in the last few decades of the 20th century Previous work failed to give a holistic explanation for three regions simultaneously, while this study attributes observed trend to aerosol The CMIP5 models with more complex treatment of aerosol‐cloud interaction capture the observed pattern better},

Some impacts might not be reversible. Hence, we explore a new set of net-zero CO2 emissions scenarios with limited overshoot. We show that upfront investments are needed in the near term for limiting temperature overshoot but that these would bring long-term economic gains. Our study further identifies alternative configurations of net-zero CO2 emissions systems and the roles of different sectors and regions for balancing sources and sinks. Even without net-negative emissions, CO2 removal is important for accelerating near-term reductions and for providing an anthropogenic sink that can offset the residual emissions in sectors that are hard to abate. Current emissions scenarios include pathways that overshoot the temperature goals set out in the Paris Agreement and rely on future net negative emissions.

	abstract = {Both climate forcing and climate sensitivity persist as stubborn uncertainties limiting the extent to which climate models can provide actionable scientific scenarios for climate change. A key, explicit control on cloud–aerosol interactions, the largest uncertainty in climate forcing, is the vertical velocity of cloud-scale updrafts. Model-based studies of climate sensitivity indicate that convective entrainment, which is closely related to updraft speeds, is an important control on climate sensitivity. Updraft vertical velocities also drive many physical processes essential to numerical weather prediction.Vertical velocities and their role in atmospheric physical processes have been given very limited attention in models for climate and numerical weather prediction. The relevant physical scales range down to tens of meters and are thus frequently sub-grid and require parameterization. Many state-of-science convection parameterizations provide mass fluxes without specifying vertical velocities, and parameterizations that do provide vertical velocities have been subject to limited evaluation against what have until recently been scant observations. Atmospheric observations imply that the distribution of vertical velocities depends on the areas over which the vertical velocities are averaged. Distributions of vertical velocities in climate models may capture this behavior, but it has not been accounted for when parameterizing cloud and precipitation processes in current models.New observations of convective vertical velocities offer a potentially promising path toward developing process-level cloud models and parameterizations for climate and numerical weather prediction. Taking account of the scale dependence of resolved vertical velocities offers a path to matching cloud-scale physical processes and their driving dynamics more realistically, with a prospect of reduced uncertainty in both climate forcing and sensitivity.},

We show first that a single pulse of carbon released into the atmosphere increases globally averaged surface temperature by an amount that remains approximately constant for several centuries, even in the absence of additional emissions. We then show that to hold climate constant at a given global temperature requires near-zero future carbon emissions. Our results suggest that future anthropogenic emissions would need to be eliminated in order to stabilize global-mean temperatures.

Nd is important as a fundamental cloud property that determines cloud albedo, precipitation‐forming processes, cloud longevity, and fractional cover, all of which determine cloud radiative effects. Nd is determined by cloud base aerosols and updrafts. Satellite retrievals of Nd for marine stratocumulus clouds are performed based on the assumption of a nearly adiabatic cloud column. The retrievals, however, are fraught with problems that cause large biases (e.g., the retrieved Nd for partially filled cloudy pixels are less than one third of the retrieved Nd for the convective cores) and limit the usefulness of Nd, especially in broken cloud fields. The Nd of the brightest 10\% of cloudy pixels are selected because the brightest clouds are the convective cores that most closely follow adiabatic parcels, a key assumption of our retrieval. It is shown that this criterion is representative of pixels that are also fully surrounded by cloudy pixels (Nd agreement within 5\%).

	abstract = {The liquid water path (LWP) adjustment due to aerosol–cloud interactions in marine stratocumulus remains a considerable source of uncertainty for climate sensitivity estimates. An unequivocal attribution of LWP adjustments to changes in aerosol concentration from climatology remains difficult due to the considerable covariance between meteorological conditions alongside changes in aerosol concentrations. We utilise the susceptibility framework to quantify the potential change in LWP adjustment with boundary layer (BL) depth in subtropical marine stratocumulus. We show that the LWP susceptibility, i.e. the relative change in LWP scaled by the relative change in cloud droplet number concentration, in marine BLs triples in magnitude from -0.1 to -0.31 as the BL deepens from 300 to 1200 m and deeper. We further find deep BLs to be underrepresented in pollution tracks, process modelling, and in situ studies of aerosol–cloud interactions in marine stratocumulus. Susceptibility estimates based on these approaches are skewed towards shallow BLs of moderate LWP susceptibility. Therefore, extrapolating LWP susceptibility estimates from shallow BLs to the entire cloud climatology may underestimate the true LWP adjustment within subtropical stratocumulus and thus overestimate the effective aerosol radiative forcing in this region. Meanwhile, LWP susceptibility estimates in deep BLs remain poorly constrained. While susceptibility estimates in shallow BLs are found to be consistent with process modelling studies, they overestimate pollution track estimates.},

We use estimates of emission changes for 2020 in two Earth System Models (ESMs) to simulate the impacts of the COVID‐19 economic changes. Ensembles of nudged simulations are used to separate small signals from meteorological variability. Reductions in aerosol and precursor emissions, chiefly black carbon and sulfate (SO4), led to reductions in total anthropogenic aerosol cooling through aerosol‐cloud interactions. The average overall Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) peaks at +0.29 ± 0.15 Wm−2 in spring 2020. Changes in cloud properties are smaller than observed changes during 2020. Impacts of these changes on regional land surface temperature range up to +0.3 K. The peak impact of these aerosol changes on global surface temperature is very small (+0.03 K). However, the aerosol changes are the largest contribution to radiative forcing and temperature changes as a result of COVID‐19 affected emissions, larger than ozone, CO2 and contrail effects. The COVID‐19 pandemic changed emissions of gases and particulates. These gases and particulates affect climate. In general, human emissions of particles cool the planet by scattering away sunlight in the clear sky and by making clouds brighter to reflect sunlight away from the earth. This paper focuses on understanding how changes to emissions of particulates (aerosols) affect climate. We use estimates of emissions changes for 2020 in two climate models to simulate the impacts of the COVID‐19 induced emission changes. We tightly constrain the models by forcing the winds to match observed winds for 2020. COVID‐19 induced lockdowns led to reductions in aerosol and precursor emissions, chiefly soot or black carbon and sulfate (SO4). This is found to reduce the human caused aerosol cooling: creating a small net warming effect on the earth in spring 2020. Changes in cloud properties are smaller than observed changes during 2020. The impact of these changes on regional land surface temperature is small (maximum +0.3 K). The impact of aerosol changes on global surface temperature is very small and lasts over several years.

Then, we present results on the atmospheric model climatology, highlighting the impact of the modifications introduced in the model code, and show how important features of interdecadal and interannual variability are simulated in a “pacemaker” coupled ensemble of 70-year runs, where portions of the tropical Indo-Pacific are constrained to follow the observed variability. Despite the very basic representation of variations in greenhouse forcing and heat transport to the deep ocean (below the 300 m domain of the TOM3 model), the coupled ensemble reproduces the variations in surface temperature over land and sea with very good accuracy, confirming the role of the Indo-Pacific as a “pacemaker” for the natural fluctuations of global-mean surface temperatures found in earlier studies. Atmospheric zonal-mean temperature trends over 50 years are also realistically simulated in the extratropical lower troposphere and up to 100 hPa in the tropics. On the interannual scale, sea-surface temperature (SST) variability in sub-tropical and tropical regions not affected by SST relaxation is underestimated (mostly because of the absence of dynamically induced variability), while extratropical SST variability during the cold seasons is comparable to that observed. Atmospheric teleconnection patterns and their connections with SST are reproduced with high fidelity, although with local differences in the amplitude of regional features (such as a larger-than-observed response of extratropical SST to North Atlantic Oscillation variability). The SPEEDY-TOM3 model also reproduces the observed connection between averages of surface heat fluxes over the oceans and land surface air temperature in the wintertime northern extratropics. Overall, as in earlier versions of SPEEDY, the fidelity of the simulations (both in terms of climatological means and variability) is higher near the surface and in the lower troposphere, while the negative impacts of the coarse vertical resolution and simplified parameterizations are mostly felt in the stratosphere. However, the improved simulation of surface heat fluxes and their impact on extratropical SST variability in this model version (obtained at a very modest computational cost) make the SPEEDY-TOM3 model a suitable tool to investigate the coupled response of the extratropical circulation to interannual and inter-decadal changes of tropical SST in ensemble experiments.},

State-of-the-art models today do not typically support the manipulation of concepts like "the existence of bone spurs", as they are trained end-to-end to go directly from raw input (e.g., pixels) to output (e.g., arthritis severity). We revisit the classic idea of first predicting concepts that are provided at training time, and then using these concepts to predict the label. By construction, we can intervene on these concept bottleneck models by editing their predicted concept values and propagating these changes to the final prediction. On x-ray grading and bird identification, concept bottleneck models achieve competitive accuracy with standard end-to-end models, while enabling interpretation in terms of high-level clinical concepts ("bone spurs") or bird attributes ("wing color"). These models also allow for richer human-model interaction: accuracy improves significantly if we can correct model mistakes on concepts at test time.},

This is particularly effective when the low- and high-fidelity models exhibit strong correlations, and can lead to significant computational gains over approaches that solely rely on high-fidelity models. However, in many cases of practical interest, low-fidelity models can only be well correlated to their high-fidelity counterparts for a specific range of input parameters, and potentially return wrong trends and erroneous predictions if probed outside of their validity regime. Here we put forth a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian process regression and nonlinear autoregressive schemes that is capable of learning complex nonlinear and space-dependent cross-correlations between models of variable fidelity, and can effectively safeguard against low-fidelity models that provide wrong trends. This introduces a new class of multi-fidelity information fusion algorithms that provide a fundamental extension to the existing linear autoregressive methodologies, while still maintaining the same algorithmic complexity and overall computational cost. The performance of the proposed methods is tested in several benchmark problems involving both synthetic and real multi-fidelity datasets from computational fluid dynamics simulations.},

Here we show that the ENSO‐CSWA teleconnection varies intraseasonally and is a combination of direct and indirect positive influences. The direct influence is through a Rossby wave‐like pattern in the tail months. The indirect influence is through an atmospheric dipole of diabatic heating anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) as a result of ENSO‐forced response, which also generates a Rossby wave‐like forcing and persists throughout the wet season. ENSO exerts its strongest influence when both direct and indirect modes are in phase, while the relationship breaks down when the two modes are out of phase. The atmospheric teleconnection through the atmospheric diabatic heating anomalies in the TIO is reproducible in numerical simulations. El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts a strong positive influence on the precipitation variability over Central Southwest Asian (CSWA) region during the wet season that spans from November to April. We note that the ENSO influence varies intraseasonally and has two components, one directly through the equatorial Pacific region and one indirectly through the tropical Indian Ocean. In both cases, ENSO exerts its influence through Rossby wave‐like atmospheric anomalies. When the two components are in phase, ENSO has the strongest influence while it is weakest when they are out of phase. These findings suggest that improvements in subseasonal to seasonal scale predictability requires the better representation of intraseasonal variability of ENSO teleconnection, as well as the role of interbasin interactions in its propagation.

	abstract = {We present a selection of methodologies for using the palaeo-climate model component of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 5) (CMIP5) to attempt to constrain future climate projections using the same models. The constraints arise from measures of skill in hindcasting palaeo-climate changes from the present over three periods: the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (21 000 yr before present, ka), the mid-Holocene (MH) (6 ka) and the Last Millennium (LM) (850–1850 CE). The skill measures may be used to validate robust patterns of climate change across scenarios or to distinguish between models that have differing outcomes in future scenarios. We find that the multi-model ensemble of palaeo-simulations is adequate for addressing at least some of these issues. For example, selected benchmarks for the LGM and MH are correlated to the rank of future projections of precipitation/temperature or sea ice extent to indicate that models that produce the best agreement with palaeo-climate information give demonstrably different future results than the rest of the models. We also explore cases where comparisons are strongly dependent on uncertain forcing time series or show important non-stationarity, making direct inferences for the future problematic. Overall, we demonstrate that there is a strong potential for the palaeo-climate simulations to help inform the future projections and urge all the modelling groups to complete this subset of the CMIP5 runs.},

In E63H23, the amount of low clouds, the liquid and ice water path, and cloud radiative effects are more realistic than in previous model versions. E63H23 has a more physically based aerosol activation scheme, improvements in the cloud cover scheme, changes in the detrainment of convective clouds, changes in the sticking efficiency for the accretion of ice crystals by snow, consistent ice crystal shapes throughout the model, and changes in mixed-phase freezing; an inconsistency in ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) in cirrus clouds was also removed. Common biases in ECHAM and in E63H23 (and in previous ECHAM–HAM versions) are a cloud amount in stratocumulus regions that is too low and deep convective clouds over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that form too close to the continents (while tropical land precipitation is underestimated). There are indications that ICNCs are overestimated in E63H23. Since clouds are important for effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFari+aci) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), differences in ERFari+aci and ECS between the model versions were also analyzed. ERFari+aci is weaker in E63H23 (-1.0 W m-2) than in E61H22 (-1.2 W m-2) (or E55H20; -1.1 W m-2). This is caused by the weaker shortwave ERFari+aci (a new aerosol activation scheme and sea salt emission parameterization in E63H23, more realistic simulation of cloud water) overcompensating for the weaker longwave ERFari+aci (removal of an inconsistency in ICNC in cirrus clouds in E61H22). The decrease in ECS in E63H23 (2.5 K) compared to E61H22 (2.8 K) is due to changes in the entrainment rate for shallow convection (affecting the cloud amount feedback) and a stronger cloud phase feedback. Experiments with minimum cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCmin) of 40 cm-3 or 10 cm-3 show that a higher value of CDNCmin reduces ERFari+aci as well as ECS in E63H23.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation (DA) is integrated with machine learning in order to perform entirely data‐driven online state estimation. To achieve this, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are implemented as pretrained surrogate models to replace key components of the DA cycle in numerical weather prediction (NWP), including the conventional numerical forecast model, the forecast error covariance matrix, and the tangent linear and adjoint models. It is shown how these RNNs can be initialized using DA methods to directly update the hidden/reservoir state with observations of the target system. The results indicate that these techniques can be applied to estimate the state of a system for the repeated initialization of short‐term forecasts, even in the absence of a traditional numerical forecast model. Further, it is demonstrated how these integrated RNN‐DA methods can scale to higher dimensions by applying domain localization and parallelization, providing a path for practical applications in NWP. Weather forecast models derived from fundamental equations of physics continue to increase in detail and complexity. While this evolution leads to consistently improving daily weather forecasts, it also leads to associated increases in computational costs. In order to make a forecast at any given moment, these models must be initialized with our best guess of the current state of the atmosphere, which typically includes information from a limited set of observations as well as forecasts from the recent past. Modern methods for initializing these computer forecasts typically require running many copies of the model, either simultaneously or in sequence, to compare with observations over the recent past and ensure that our best guess estimate of the current state of the atmosphere agrees closely with those observations before making a new forecast. This repeated execution of the computer forecast model is often a time‐consuming and costly bottleneck in the initialization process. Here, it is shown that techniques from the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can be used to produce simple surrogate models that provide sufficiently accurate approximations to replace the original costly model in the initialization phase. The resulting process is self‐contained, and does not require any further utilization of the original computer model when making daily forecasts.

Results in 1‐year independent offline validation show that ResCu‐en has high prediction accuracy for all output variables, both in the current climate and in a warmer climate with +4K sea surface temperature. The analysis of different neural net configurations shows that the success to generalize in a warmer climate is attributed to convective memory and the 1‐dimensional convolution layers incorporated into ResCu‐en. We further implement a member of ResCu‐en into CAM5 with real world geography and run the neural‐network‐enabled CAM5 (NCAM) for 5 years without encountering any numerical integration instability. The simulation generally captures the global distribution of the mean precipitation, with a better simulation of precipitation intensity and diurnal cycle. However, there are large biases in temperature and moisture in high latitudes. These results highlight the importance of convective memory and demonstrate the potential for machine learning to enhance climate modeling. The representation of storms and clouds through empirical algorithms known as parameterizations in global climate models (GCMs) is one of the main sources of biases in the simulation of rainfall and atmospheric circulation. Here an ensemble of 8 deep neural networks are used to replace the conventional parameterization of atmospheric moist physics processes. They are trained on data sampled from 1‐year present‐day climate simulation by a “superparameterized” climate model, which uses a two‐dimensional cloud‐scale model to explicitly simulate convection and clouds inside each GCM grid box. On ensemble averaging, the neural nets produce highly accurate predictions of precipitation characteristics including global distribution and intensity. Furthermore, the machine‐learned emulator trained on data in the current climate also represents convection and precipitation extremely well in a warmer climate. A member of the ensemble of the neural nets is implemented into a GCM. The model is then integrated for 5 years, producing reasonable results.

	abstract = {This work documents version two of the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). E3SMv2 is a significant evolution from its predecessor E3SMv1, resulting in a model that is nearly twice as fast and with a simulated climate that is improved in many metrics. We describe the physical climate model in its lower horizontal resolution configuration consisting of 110 km atmosphere, 165 km land, 0.5° river routing model, and an ocean and sea ice with mesh spacing varying between 60 km in the mid‐latitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles. The model performance is evaluated with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations augmented with historical simulations as well as simulations to evaluate impacts of different forcing agents. The simulated climate has many realistic features of the climate system, with notable improvements in clouds and precipitation compared to E3SMv1. E3SMv1 suffered from an excessively high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 5.3 K. In E3SMv2, ECS is reduced to 4.0 K which is now within the plausible range based on a recent World Climate Research Program assessment. However, a number of important biases remain including a weak Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, deficiencies in the characteristics and spectral distribution of tropical atmospheric variability, and a significant underestimation of the observed warming in the second half of the historical period. An analysis of single‐forcing simulations indicates that correcting the historical temperature bias would require a substantial reduction in the magnitude of the aerosol‐related forcing. The U.S. Department of Energy recently released version two of its Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). E3SMv2 experienced a significant evolution in many of its model components (most notably the atmosphere and sea ice models), and its supporting software infrastructure. In this work, we document the computational performance of E3SMv2 and analyze its ability to reproduce the observed climate. To accomplish this, we utilize the standard Diagnosis and Evaluation and Characterization of Klima experiments augmented with historical simulations for the period 1850–2015. We find that E3SMv2 is nearly twice as fast as its predecessor and more accurately reproduces the observed climate in a number of metrics, most notably clouds and precipitation. We also find that the model's simulated response to increasing carbon dioxide (the equilibrium climate sensitivity) is much more realistic. Unfortunately, E3SMv2 underestimates the global mean surface temperature compared to observations during the second half of historical period. Using sensitivity experiments, where forcing agents (carbon dioxide, aerosols) are selectively disabled in the model, we determine that correcting this problem would require a strong reduction in the impact of aerosols. E3SMv2 is nearly twice as fast as E3SMv1 with a simulated climate that is improved in many metrics (e.g., precipitation and clouds) Climate sensitivity is substantially lower with a more plausible equilibrium climate sensitivity of 4.0 K (compared to an unlikely value of 5.3 K in E3SMv1) E3SMv2 underestimates the warming in the late historical period due to excessive aerosol‐related forcing E3SMv2 is nearly twice as fast as E3SMv1 with a simulated climate that is improved in many metrics (e.g., precipitation and clouds) Climate sensitivity is substantially lower with a more plausible equilibrium climate sensitivity of 4.0 K (compared to an unlikely value of 5.3 K in E3SMv1) E3SMv2 underestimates the warming in the late historical period due to excessive aerosol‐related forcing},

This in turn leads to large uncertainties in the contributions of the direct and indirect aerosol forcing on climate. Using the Global Aerosol Synthesis and Science Project (GASSP) database – the largest synthesised collection of in situ aircraft measurements currently available, with more than 1000 flights from 37 campaigns from around the world – we investigate the vertical structure of submicron aerosols across a wide range of regions and environments. The application of this unique dataset to assess the vertical distributions of number size distribution and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the global aerosol–climate model ECHAM-HAM reveals that the model underestimates accumulation-mode particles in the upper troposphere, especially in remote regions. The processes underlying this discrepancy are explored using different aerosol microphysical schemes and a process sensitivity analysis. These show that the biases are predominantly related to aerosol ageing and removal rather than emissions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Summary.  Many modern statistical applications involve inference for complex stochastic models, where it is easy to simulate from the models, but impossible to calculate likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate ABC analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

Measurements from networks of ground sites, a research ship, tall towers, balloon-borne ozonesondes, multiple aircraft, and satellites provided in situ and remotely sensed data on trace pollutant and greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol chemical composition and microphysical properties, cloud microphysics, and meteorological parameters. This overview report provides operational information for the variety of sites, platforms, and measurements, their joint deployment strategy, and summarizes findings that have resulted from the collaborative analyses of the CalNex field study. Climate-relevant findings from CalNex include that leakage from natural gas infrastructure may account for the excess of observed methane over emission estimates in Los Angeles. Air-quality relevant findings include the following: mobile fleet VOC significantly declines, and NOx emissions continue to have an impact on ozone in the Los Angeles basin; the relative contributions of diesel and gasoline emission to secondary organic aerosol are not fully understood; and nighttime NO3 chemistry contributes significantly to secondary organic aerosol mass in the San Joaquin Valley. Findings simultaneously relevant to climate and air quality include the following: marine vessel emissions changes due to fuel sulfur and speed controls result in a net warming effect but have substantial positive impacts on local air quality.},

	abstract = {The representations of clouds, aerosols, and cloud–aerosol–radiation impacts remain some of the largest uncertainties in climate change, limiting our ability to accurately reconstruct past climate and predict future climate. The south-east Atlantic is a region where high atmospheric aerosol loadings and semi-permanent stratocumulus clouds are co-located, providing an optimum region for studying the full range of aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions and their perturbations of the Earth's radiation budget. While satellite measurements have provided some useful insights into aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions over the region, these observations do not have the spatial and temporal resolution, nor the required level of precision to allow for a process-level assessment. Detailed measurements from high spatial and temporal resolution airborne atmospheric measurements in the region are very sparse, limiting their use in assessing the performance of aerosol modelling in numerical weather prediction and climate models. CLARIFY-2017 was a major consortium programme consisting of five principal UK universities with project partners from the UK Met Office and European- and USA-based universities and research centres involved in the complementary ORACLES, LASIC, and AEROCLO-sA projects. The aims of CLARIFY-2017 were fourfold: (1) to improve the representation and reduce uncertainty in model estimates of the direct, semi-direct, and indirect radiative effect of absorbing biomass burning aerosols; (2) to improve our knowledge and representation of the processes determining stratocumulus cloud microphysical and radiative properties and their transition to cumulus regimes; (3) to challenge, validate, and improve satellite retrievals of cloud and aerosol properties and their radiative impacts; (4) to improve the impacts of aerosols in weather and climate numerical models.

	abstract = {The influence of aerosol particles on cloud reflectivity remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. Commercial shipping constitutes a large and concentrated aerosol perturbation in a meteorological regime where clouds have a disproportionally large effect on climate. Yet, to date, studies have been unable to detect climatologically relevant cloud radiative effects from shipping, despite models indicating that the cloud response should produce a sizable negative radiative forcing (perturbation to Earth's energy balance). We attribute a significant increase in cloud reflectivity to enhanced cloud droplet number concentrations within a major shipping corridor in the southeast Atlantic. Prevailing winds constrain emissions around the corridor, which cuts through a climatically important region of expansive low cloud cover. We use universal kriging, a classic geostatistical method, to estimate what cloud properties would have been in the absence of shipping. In the morning, cloud brightening is consistent with changes in microphysics alone, whereas in the afternoon, increases in cloud brightness from microphysical changes are offset by decreases in the total amount of cloud water. We calculate an effective radiative forcing within the southeast Atlantic shipping corridor of approximately −2 W/m2. Several years of data are required to identify a clear signal. Extrapolating our results globally, we calculate an effective radiative forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions in low clouds of −1.0 W/m2 (95\% confidence interval: −1.6 to −0.4 W/m2). The unique setup in the southeast Atlantic could be an ideal test for the representation of aerosol‐cloud interactions in climate models. One of the biggest challenges in quantifying the human influence on Earth's climate is understanding how small airborne particles (“aerosol”) influence cloud properties. Increasing aerosol increases the brightness of low‐lying clouds, exerting a cooling effect on the climate that partially offsets some of the warming caused by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Ship tracks, or lines of cloud changes due to pollution from individual ships, have long been studied as a prime example of these cloud‐aerosol interactions in action. Mysteriously, however, previous attempts to measure ship tracks globally found very small effects, even though climate models predict large effects. We analyze a shipping corridor in the southeast Atlantic where the winds blow in such a way that the ships' pollution remains constrained around the corridor. This allows us to estimate what the clouds in the shipping corridor would look like without the effects of ships by using the properties of nearby, non‐shipping‐affected clouds. For the first time, we observe a substantial increase in cloud brightness caused by shipping on a regional scale. Applying cloud‐aerosol relationships calculated within the shipping corridor to state‐of‐the‐art climate model data, we estimate how much pollution‐induced cloud changes have changed Earth's energy balance since the pre‐industrial era. For the first time, observations show that ship emissions induce a cloud brightening effect on climate‐relevant spatial and temporal scales Brightening is dominated by an increase in the number of cloud droplets, with small or countervailing adjustments in liquid water path Observationally informed global effective radiative forcing in low clouds is calculated as −1.0 W/m2 (−1.6 to −0.4 W/m2)},

Because mixing ratios are determined and not mass concentration, the vertical fluxes obtained did not suffer from “Webb effect” errors. High sensitivity at high humidities was achieved by efficient drying and by preheating the sampled air to about 400 °C.

	abstract = {The long-standing expectation that poleward shifts of the midlatitude jet under global warming will lead to poleward shifts of clouds and a positive radiative feedback on the climate system has been shown to be misguided by several recent studies. On interannual time scales, free-tropospheric clouds are observed to shift along with the jet, but low clouds increase across a broad expanse of the North Pacific Ocean basin, resulting in negligible changes in total cloud fraction and top-of-atmosphere radiation. Here it is shown that this low-cloud response is consistent across eight independent satellite-derived cloud products. Using multiple linear regression, it is demonstrated that the spatial pattern and magnitude of the low-cloud-coverage response is primarily driven by anomalous surface temperature advection. In the eastern North Pacific, anomalous cold advection by anomalous northerly surface winds enhances sensible and latent heat fluxes from the ocean into the boundary layer, resulting in large increases in low-cloud coverage. Local increases in low-level stability make a smaller contribution to this low-cloud increase. Despite closely capturing the observed response of large-scale meteorology to jet shifts, global climate models largely fail to capture the observed response of clouds and radiation to interannual jet shifts because they systematically underestimate how sensitive low clouds are to surface temperature advection, and to a lesser extent, low-level stability. More realistic model simulations of cloud–radiation–jet interactions require that parameterizations more accurately capture the sensitivity of low clouds to surface temperature advection.},

	abstract = {Small shallow cumulus clouds ({\textless} 1 km) over the tropical oceans appear to possess the ability to self-organise into mesoscale (10-100 km) patterns. To better understand the processes leading to such self-organized convection, we present Cloud Botany, an ensemble of 103 large-eddy simulations on domains of 150 km, produced by the Dutch Large Eddy Simulation (DALES) model on supercomputer Fugaku. Each simulation is run in an idealized, fixed, larger-scale environment, controlled by six free parameters. We vary these over characteristic ranges for the winter trades, including parameter combinations observed during the EUREC4A (Elucidating the role of clouds–circulation coupling in climate) field campaign. In contrast to simulation setups striving for maximum realism, Cloud Botany provides a platform for studying idealized, and therefore more clearly interpretable causal relationships between conditions in the larger-scale environment and patterns in mesoscale, self-organized shallow convection. We find that any simulation that supports cumulus clouds eventually develops mesoscale patterns in their cloud fields. We also find a rich variety in these patterns as our control parameters change, including cold pools lined by cloudy arcs, bands of cross-wind clouds and aggregated patches, sometimes topped by thin anvils. Many of these features are similar to cloud patterns found in nature. The published data set consists of raw simulation output on full 3D grids and 2D cross-sections, as well as post-processed quantities aggregated over the vertical (2D), horizontal (1D) and all spatial dimensions (time-series). The data set is directly accessible from Python through the use of the EUREC4A intake catalog.},

Ship-track frequency is more than 10 times higher than a previous survey, and its interannual fluctuations reflect variations in cross-ocean trade, shipping activity, and fuel regulations. Fuel regulation can alter both detected frequency and shipping routes due to cost. The 2020 fuel regulation, together with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, reduced ship-track frequency to its lowest level in recent decades across the globe and may have ushered in an era of low frequency. The regulation reduces the aerosol indirect forcing from ship emissions by 46\% or between 0.02 and 0.27 W m−2 given its current estimates.},

But although the forecasting of hurricane tracks has improved over the past 30 years, the factors that control the intensity of hurricanes are still poorly understood, leading to almost no reliability in forecasts of hurricane intensity evolution. Efforts to improve intensity forecasts have focused almost exclusively on characterizing the dynamical interactions between hurricanes and their atmospheric environment. Here I use a simple numerical model to demonstrate that, in most cases, the evolution of hurricane intensity depends mainly on three factors: the storm's initial intensity, the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere through which it moves, and the heat exchange with the upper layer of the ocean under the core of the hurricane. Such a limited number of controlling factors offers hope that, given an accurate forecast of a hurricane's track, its intensity can be reliably forecast using very simple models.},

	abstract = {Forecasting a time series from multivariate predictors constitutes a challenging problem, especially using model-free approaches. Most techniques, such as nearest-neighbor prediction, quickly suffer from the curse of dimensionality and overfitting for more than a few predictors which has limited their application mostly to the univariate case. Therefore, selection strategies are needed that harness the available information as efficiently as possible. Since often the right combination of predictors matters, ideally all subsets of possible predictors should be tested for their predictive power, but the exponentially growing number of combinations makes such an approach computationally prohibitive. Here a prediction scheme that overcomes this strong limitation is introduced utilizing a causal preselection step which drastically reduces the number of possible predictors to the most predictive set of causal drivers making a globally optimal search scheme tractable. The information-theoretic optimality is derived and practical selection criteria are discussed. As demonstrated for multivariate nonlinear stochastic delay processes, the optimal scheme can even be less computationally expensive than commonly used suboptimal schemes like forward selection. The method suggests a general framework to apply the optimal model-free approach to select variables and subsequently fit a model to further improve a prediction or learn statistical dependencies. The performance of this framework is illustrated on a climatological index of El Niño Southern Oscillation.},

	abstract = {The physical mechanisms that affect the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) are investigated using a two-box equilibrium model of the Tropics. One box represents the convecting, warm SST, high humidity region of the Tropics, and the other box represents the subsidence region with low humidity, boundary layer clouds, and cooler SST. The two regions communicate by energy and moisture fluxes that are proportional to the strength of the overturning circulation that couples the two regions. The boundary layer properties in the subsiding region are predicted with a mixing line model. Humidity above the inversion in the subsiding region is predicted from moisture conservation. The humidity above the inversion in the subsiding region increases rapidly with temperature, but this has less effect on the sensitivity than expected, because the inversion lowers as the humidity above the inversion is increased. Some of the increased greenhouse effect of the free troposphere can be offset by decreased greenhouse effect of the boundary layer. Increasing the area of the warm, convective region increases the SSTs, because of the greenhouse effect of the greater upper-tropospheric water vapor in the convective region. The circulation strength is constrained by radiative cooling in the cold pool. The strength of the circulation decreases with increasing convective area, because the increase in dry static stability overwhelms the increase in cooling rate. Although they have strong individual effects on longwave and shortwave radiation, high clouds in the convective region do not affect the tropical SSTs strongly, because their net radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere is small. Low clouds in the subsidence region have a strong cooling affect on the tropical SST, because they strongly reduce net radiative heating at the top of the atmosphere. A negative feedback is produced if the low clouds are predicted from the observed relationship between stratus cloud amount and lower-tropospheric stability.},

These correlations suggest systematic invigoration of convective clouds by pollution, desert dust and biomass burning aerosols.

The central focus of the experiment was a two-week deployment of the UK BAe-146-301 Atmospheric Research Aircraft (ARA) over eastern Canada, based out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Atmospheric ground-based and sonde measurements over Canada and the Azores associated with the planned July 2010 deployment of the ARA, which was postponed by 12 months due to UK-based flights related to the dispersal of material emitted by the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, went ahead and constituted phase A of the experiment. Phase B of BORTAS in July 2011 involved the same atmospheric measurements, but included the ARA, special satellite observations and a more comprehensive ground-based measurement suite. The high-frequency aircraft data provided a comprehensive chemical snapshot of pyrogenic plumes from wildfires, corresponding to photochemical (and physical) ages ranging from 45 sr 10 days, largely by virtue of widespread fires over Northwestern Ontario. Airborne measurements reported a large number of emitted gases including semi-volatile species, some of which have not been been previously reported in pyrogenic plumes, with the corresponding emission ratios agreeing with previous work for common gases. Analysis of the NOy data shows evidence of net ozone production in pyrogenic plumes, controlled by aerosol abundance, which increases as a function of photochemical age. The coordinated ground-based and sonde data provided detailed but spatially limited information that put the aircraft data into context of the longer burning season in the boundary layer. Ground-based measurements of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) over Halifax show that forest fires can on an episodic basis represent a substantial contribution to total surface PM2.5.},

	abstract = {Summary.  In many areas of science and technology, mathematical models are built to simulate complex real world phenomena. Such models are typically implemented in large computer programs and are also very complex, such that the way that the model responds to changes in its inputs is not transparent. Sensitivity analysis is concerned with understanding how changes in the model inputs influence the outputs. This may be motivated simply by a wish to understand the implications of a complex model but often arises because there is uncertainty about the true values of the inputs that should be used for a particular application. A broad range of measures have been advocated in the literature to quantify and describe the sensitivity of a model's output to variation in its inputs. In practice the most commonly used measures are those that are based on formulating uncertainty in the model inputs by a joint probability distribution and then analysing the induced uncertainty in outputs, an approach which is known as probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We present a Bayesian framework which unifies the various tools of prob- abilistic sensitivity analysis. The Bayesian approach is computationally highly efficient. It allows effective sensitivity analysis to be achieved by using far smaller numbers of model runs than standard Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, all measures of interest may be computed from a single set of runs.},

Previous analyses of this risk have been based either on expert opinion1, perturbation analysis of simplified climate models2,3,4,5 or the comparison of predictions from general circulation models6. Recent observed changes that appear to be attributable to human influence7,8,9,10,11,12 provide a powerful constraint on the uncertainties in multi-decadal forecasts. Here we assess the range of warming rates over the coming 50 years that are consistent with the observed near-surface temperature record as well as with the overall patterns of response predicted by several general circulation models. We expect global mean temperatures in the decade 2036–46 to be 1–2.5 K warmer than in pre-industrial times under a ‘business as usual’ emission scenario. This range is relatively robust to errors in the models' climate sensitivity, rate of oceanic heat uptake or global response to sulphate aerosols as long as these errors are persistent over time. Substantial changes in the current balance of greenhouse warming and sulphate aerosol cooling would, however, increase the uncertainty. Unlike 50-year warming rates, the final equilibrium warming after the atmospheric composition stabilizes remains very uncertain, despite the evidence provided by the emerging signal.},

	abstract = {In May 2008 the EUCAARI-LONGREX aircraft field campaign was conducted within the EUCAARI intensive observational period. The campaign aimed at studying the distribution and evolution of air mass properties on a continental scale. Airborne aerosol and trace gas measurements were performed aboard the German DLR Falcon 20 and the British FAAM BAe-146 aircraft. This paper outlines the meteorological situation over Europe during May 2008 and the temporal and spatial evolution of predominantly anthropogenic particulate pollution inside the boundary layer and the free troposphere. Time series data of six selected ground stations are used to discuss continuous measurements besides the single flights. The observations encompass total and accumulation mode particle number concentration (0.1–0.8 μm) and black carbon mass concentration as well as several meteorological parameters. Vertical profiles of total aerosol number concentration up to 10 km are compared to vertical profiles probed during previous studies. During the first half of May 2008 an anticyclonic blocking event dominated the weather over Central Europe. It led to increased pollutant concentrations within the centre of the high pressure inside the boundary layer. Due to long-range transport the accumulated pollution was partly advected towards Western and Northern Europe. The measured aerosol number concentrations over Central Europe showed in the boundary layer high values up to 14 000 cm−3 for particles in diameter larger 10 nm and 2300 cm−3 for accumulation mode particles during the high pressure period, whereas the middle free troposphere showed rather low concentrations of particulates. Thus a strong negative gradient of aerosol concentrations between the well mixed boundary layer and the clean middle troposphere occurred.},

Increased aerosol concentrations due to human activity affect droplet number concentration, liquid water and cloud fraction2, but these changes are subject to large uncertainties3. Ship tracks, long lines of polluted clouds that are visible in satellite images, are one of the main tools for quantifying aerosol–cloud interactions4. However, only a small fraction of the clouds polluted by shipping show ship tracks5,6. Here we show that even when no ship tracks are visible in satellite images, aerosol emissions change cloud properties substantially. We develop a new method to quantify the effect of shipping on all clouds, showing a cloud droplet number increase and a more positive liquid water response when there are no visible tracks. We directly detect shipping-induced cloud property changes in the trade cumulus regions of the Atlantic, which are known to display almost no visible tracks. Our results indicate that previous studies of ship tracks were suffering from selection biases by focusing only on visible tracks from satellite imagery. The strong liquid water path response we find translates to a larger aerosol cooling effect on the climate, potentially masking a higher climate sensitivity than observed temperature trends would otherwise suggest. Investigations of the effect of aerosol emissions from shipping on cloud properties when both visible and invisible ship tracks are considered implies a large negative radiative effect (and associated cooling) from liquid water path adjustments.},

The key information for performing this estimation lies in the temporal inter-dependencies between the signal and the model. We propose a kernel-based score to compare these dependencies. Our score generalizes a maximum likelihood estimator for a linear model to a general nonlinear setting in an unknown feature space. We estimate the system’s underlying parameters by maximizing the proposed score.

Here, a technique is introduced that reduces the computational cost of these experiments by an order of magnitude: instead of fixing the carbon-dioxide concentration and equilibrating the sea-surface temperature (SST), this technique fixes the SST and equilibrates the carbon-dioxide concentration. Using this approach in a cloud-resolving model of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), the equilibrated SST is obtained as a continuous function of carbon-dioxide concentrations spanning 1 ppmv to nearly 10,000 ppmv, revealing a dramatic increase in equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) at higher temperatures. This increase in ECS is due to both an increase in forcing and a decrease in the feedback parameter. In addition, the technique is used to obtain the direct effects of carbon dioxide, i.e., the rapid adjustments, over a wide range of SSTs. Overall, the direct effect of carbon dioxide offsets a quarter of the increase in precipitation from warming, reduces the shallow cloud fraction by a small amount, and has no impact on convective available potential energy (CAPE).},

	abstract = {Quantifying the efficacy of different climate forcings is important for understanding the real‐world climate sensitivity. This study presents a systematic multimodel analysis of different climate driver efficacies using simulations from the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP). Efficacies calculated from instantaneous radiative forcing deviate considerably from unity across forcing agents and models. Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is a better predictor of global mean near‐surface air temperature (GSAT) change. Efficacies are closest to one when ERF is computed using fixed sea surface temperature experiments and adjusted for land surface temperature changes using radiative kernels. Multimodel mean efficacies based on ERF are close to one for global perturbations of methane, sulfate, black carbon, and insolation, but there is notable intermodel spread. We do not find robust evidence that the geographic location of sulfate aerosol affects its efficacy. GSAT is found to respond more slowly to aerosol forcing than CO2 in the early stages of simulations. Despite these differences, we find that there is no evidence for an efficacy effect on historical GSAT trend estimates based on simulations with an impulse response model, nor on the resulting estimates of climate sensitivity derived from the historical period. However, the considerable intermodel spread in the computed efficacies means that we cannot rule out an efficacy‐induced bias of ±0.4 K in equilibrium climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling when estimated using the historical GSAT trend. Does the climate respond in the same way to carbon dioxide as it does to methane or aerosol changes? The simple way of thinking about forcing and response in the Earth system assumes that it does, such that, a Watt per square meter forcing from CO2 has the same response as an equivalent forcing from aerosols. Recent work has suggested that this might not be true and that differences in how effective different forcings are at increasing surface temperature (their efficacy) may account for a low estimate of climate sensitivity when examining historical change. We show this all depends on how you estimate your Watts per meter squared forcing in the first place. Using the effective radiative forcing concept to estimate forcing strength makes temperature changes far more predictable, and a lot of these issues with efficacy variation are not as pronounced as they were with earlier definitions. Multimodel mean efficacies computed using effective radiative forcing are close to one for major anthropogenic drivers, but there is notable intermodel spread Surface temperature‐driven radiative feedbacks are generally not constant through time across forcing experiments PDRMIP results suggest that the efficacy impact on equilibrium climate sensitivity derived from the historical period is limited to ±0.4 °C or better},

Despite decades of studies in marine environments, a direct relationship has yet to be established between ocean biology and the physicochemical properties of SSA. The ability to establish such relationships is hindered by the fact that SSA measurements are typically dominated by overwhelming background aerosol concentrations even in remote marine environments. Herein, we describe a newly developed approach for reproducing the chemical complexity of SSA in a laboratory setting, comprising a unique ocean-atmosphere facility equipped with actual breaking waves. A mesocosm experiment was performed in natural seawater, using controlled phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria concentrations, which showed SSA size and chemical mixing state are acutely sensitive to the aerosol production mechanism, as well as to the type of biological species present. The largest reduction in the hygroscopicity of SSA occurred as heterotrophic bacteria concentrations increased, whereas phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a concentrations decreased, directly corresponding to a change in mixing state in the smallest (60–180 nm) size range. Using this newly developed approach to generate realistic SSA, systematic studies can now be performed to advance our fundamental understanding of the impact of ocean biology on SSA chemical mixing state, heterogeneous reactivity, and the resulting climate-relevant properties.},

	abstract = {As the atmosphere warms, part of the cloud population shifts from ice and mixed-phase (‘cold’) to liquid (‘warm’) clouds. Because warm clouds are more reflective and longer-lived, this phase change reduces the solar flux absorbed by the Earth and constitutes a negative radiative feedback. This cooling feedback is weaker in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) than in the fifth phase (CMIP5), contributing to greater greenhouse warming. Although this change is often attributed to improvements in the simulated cloud phase, another model bias persists: warm clouds precipitate too readily, potentially leading to underestimated negative lifetime feedbacks. In this study we modified a climate model to better simulate warm-rain probability and found that it exhibits a cloud lifetime feedback nearly three times larger than the default model. This suggests that model errors in cloud-precipitation processes may bias cloud feedbacks by as much as the CMIP5-to-CMIP6 climate sensitivity difference. Reliable climate model projections therefore require improved cloud process realism guided by process-oriented observations and observational constraints. CMIP6 models simulate higher and more accurate cloud liquid water fraction relative to CMIP5, but both ensembles overestimate warm cloud precipitation. Correcting these warm cloud processes in a model exposes compensating biases large enough to offset CMIP5–CMIP6 climate sensitivity differences.},

However, ECS inferred from simulations in which sea surface temperatures are prescribed according to observations is lower still. ECS inferred from simulations with prescribed sea surface temperatures is strongly linked to changes to tropical marine low clouds.

Here, using an ensemble of 27 climate models, we study the relative importance of these two budgetary constraints and present analysis of the spatial scales at which they hold. We show that specific geographical locations are more constrained by either one of the budgets and that the combination of water and energy budgets provides a significantly stronger constraint on the spatial scale of precipitation changes under anthropogenic climate change (on average about 3000 km, above which changes in precipitation approach the global mean change).

However, the NN method demonstrates significant advantages: 1) it withdraws the linearity assumption of the kernel method and accounts for the nonlinear effects of the feedbacks. In the case of large climate perturbations, such as that in the Arctic caused by sea ice melt, the NN method achieves better radiation closure. 2) The method can directly calculate the radiative feedback of cloud and its components.

It is shown that similar notions apply to slab ocean simulations of global warming. Nine slab ocean model simulations from different modeling centers show a wide range of ITCZ shifts in response to doubling carbon dioxide concentrations, which are experienced in a rather zonally symmetric way in the tropics. Using an attribution strategy based on fundamental energetic constraints, it is shown that responses of clouds and ice in the extratropics explain much of the range of ITCZ responses. There are also some positive feedbacks within the tropics due to increasing water vapor content and high clouds in the new ITCZ location, which amplify the changes driven from the extratropics. This study shows the clear importance of simulating extratropical climate responses with fidelity, because in addition to their local importance, the impacts of these climate responses have a large nonlocal impact on rainfall in the tropics.},

Four sea-salt emissions parameterizations were incorporated into the GISS II-prime general circulation model with the size-resolved aerosol microphysics module, TOMAS. The results of the four simulations were compared to observations of monthly average PM10 sea-salt mass, sea-salt mass size distributions, and marine aerosol number distributions. The agreement of the simulations with the observations varied greatly based on the sea-salt emissions parameterization used, but validation of the parameterizations is limited by uncertainty in the model's wind speeds. The impact of sea-salt aerosols on CCN concentrations was assessed by looking at the percent change in CCN(0.2\%) concentrations between a simulation including both sea salt and sulfate and a simulation including sulfate alone. Two of the emissions parameterizations included ultrafine sea-salt particles, and the contribution of the ultrafine particles to CCN(0.2\%) formation was assessed by sensitivity studies. Depending on the emissions estimate used, the addition of sea salt increased CCN(0.2\%) over the Southern Ocean by 150\% to 500\%. The highest increases resulted from the simulations that included ultrafine emissions where it was found that the ultrafine sea salt can increase CCN(0.2\%) concentrations over both the Southern Ocean and Antarctica by more than 50\% relative to the same parameterizations with ultrafine sea salt excluded. The sensitivity of CCN(0.2\%) to ultrafine sea-salt emissions enhances the importance of reducing the uncertainty of sea-salt emissions parameterizations and their subsequent treatment in aerosol models.},

	abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of precipitation characteristics (mean, extreme, and diurnal cycle) to a set of uncertain parameters that influence the qualitative and quantitative behavior of cloud and aerosol processes in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5). We adopt both the Latin hypercube and Quasi‐Monte Carlo sampling approaches to effectively explore the high‐dimensional parameter space and then conduct two large sets of simulations. One set consists of 1100 simulations (cloud ensemble) perturbing 22 parameters related to cloud physics and convection, and the other set consists of 256 simulations (aerosol ensemble) focusing on 16 parameters related to aerosols and cloud microphysics. In the cloud ensemble, six parameters having the greatest influences on the global mean precipitation are identified, three of which (related to the deep convection scheme) are the primary contributors to the total variance of the phase and amplitude of the precipitation diurnal cycle over land. The extreme precipitation characteristics are sensitive to a fewer number of parameters. Precipitation does not always respond monotonically to parameter change. The influence of individual parameters does not depend on the sampling approaches or concomitant parameters selected. Generally, the Generalized Linear Model is able to explain more of the parametric sensitivity of global precipitation than local or regional features. The total explained variance for precipitation is primarily due to contributions from the individual parameters (75–90\% in total). The total variance shows a significant seasonal variability in midlatitude continental regions, but very small in tropical continental regions. Parametric sensitivity of precipitation and their dependence are quantified Precipitation does not respond linearly and monotonically to parameter change Much of sensitivity is from independent parameters instead of their interactions},

State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536 km × 1,280 km and with lead times from 5-90 min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

	abstract = {A large number of processes are involved in the chain from emissions of aerosol precursor gases and primary particles to impacts on cloud radiative forcing. Those processes are manifest in a number of relationships that can be expressed as factors dlnX/dlnY driving aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcing. These factors include the relationships between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and emissions, droplet number and CCN concentration, cloud fraction and droplet number, cloud optical depth and droplet number, and cloud radiative forcing and cloud optical depth. The relationship between cloud optical depth and droplet number can be further decomposed into the sum of two terms involving the relationship of droplet effective radius and cloud liquid water path with droplet number. These relationships can be constrained using observations of recent spatial and temporal variability of these quantities. However, we are most interested in the radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Because few relevant measurements are available from that era, relationships from recent variability have been assumed to be applicable to the preindustrial to present-day change. Our analysis of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) model simulations suggests that estimates of relationships from recent variability are poor constraints on relationships from anthropogenic change for some terms, with even the sign of some relationships differing in many regions. Proxies connecting recent spatial/temporal variability to anthropogenic change, or sustained measurements in regions where emissions have changed, are needed to constrain estimates of anthropogenic aerosol impacts on cloud radiative forcing.},

The computed fluxes are validated using the TOA fluxes observed by the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES). Applications of the CERES-PRP methodology are demonstrated by computing the individual contributions to the variability of the radiation budget over multiple years and by deriving water vapor radiative kernels. The calculations for the former are used to show that an approximately linear decomposition of the total flux anomalies is achieved.

This has been done in general terms through consideration of the tropical beat budget and in specific terms through consideration of an idealized radiative-dynamic model of the tropical general circulation. It is argued that evaporation on its own cannot provide an effective regulating mechanism. Clouds cannot serve as regulators unless there are substantial departures from the observed cancellation between cloud greenhouse and cloud albedo effects. In particular, it is shown that the prediction by Ramanathan and Collins of highly stable tropical climates is based on an inconsistent set of assumptions about the behavior of the atmospheric heat transports. When the heat transports are treated in a consistent manner, clouds are found to have little impact, and the tropical climate can he quite sensitive to radiative perturbations. It is found that the main determinant of tropical climate is the clear-sky water vapor greenhouse effect averaged over the entire Tropics. In the absence of dry “radiator fins” maintained by subsidence, the tropical temperature would tend to fall into a runaway greenhouse state that could be stabilized only by heat export to the extratropics. Some speculative results on sensitivity of the climate to perturbations are presented. Determination of the relative area of dry and subsiding versus moist and convecting regions of the Tropics, and of the degree of dryness of the subsiding regions, are identified as key unsolved problems concerning the tropical climate.},

	abstract = {Over the last 20 years, climate models have been developed to an impressive level of complexity. They are core tools in the study of the interactions of many climatic processes and justifiably provide an additional strand in the argument that anthropogenic climate change is a critical global problem. Over a similar period, there has been growing interest in the interpretation and probabilistic analysis of the output of computer models; particularly, models of natural systems. The results of these areas of research are being sought and utilized in the development of policy, in other academic disciplines, and more generally in societal decision making. Here, our focus is solely on complex climate models as predictive tools on decadal and longer time scales. We argue for a reassessment of the role of such models when used for this purpose and a reconsideration of strategies for model development and experimental design. Building on more generic work, we categorize sources of uncertainty as they relate to this specific problem and discuss experimental strategies available for their quantification. Complex climate models, as predictive tools for many variables and scales, cannot be meaningfully calibrated because they are simulating a never before experienced state of the system; the problem is one of extrapolation. It is therefore inappropriate to apply any of the currently available generic techniques which utilize observations to calibrate or weight models to produce forecast probabilities for the real world. To do so is misleading to the users of climate science in wider society. In this context, we discuss where we derive confidence in climate forecasts and present some concepts to aid discussion and communicate the state-of-the-art. Effective communication of the underlying assumptions and sources of forecast uncertainty is critical in the interaction between climate science, the impacts communities and society in general.},

We estimate that temperatures during the southcentral North America event were 1.18° to 1.42°C warmer because of global warming and that similar events will occur 0.14 to 0.60 times per year at 2.0°C above preindustrial levels of GMT. Additionally, we find that the learned relationships between daily temperature and GMT are influenced by the seasonality of the forced temperature response and the daily meteorological conditions. Our results broadly agree with other attribution techniques, suggesting that machine learning can be used to perform rapid, low-cost attribution of extreme events.},

The dual cones to the cones of direction of decrease and to the cones of directions of nonincrease are characterized for convex functionals without differentiability, with the aid of their subdifferential, making the optimality theorems applicable. The theory is applied to vector mathematical programming, giving a generalized Fritz John theorem, and other applications are mentioned.

With a collocated Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometer, a nearby Chemical Speciation Network (PM2.5) measurement station, and near daily ozonesonde releases for the August–September SEAC4RS campaign, the site allowed the region's first comprehensive diurnal monitoring of aerosol particle vertical structure.

A principle component analysis was performed to identify key modes of variability in aerosol backscatter. “Fair weather” days exhibited classic planetary boundary layer structure of a mixed layer accounting for {\textasciitilde}50\% of AOT and an entrainment zone providing another 25\%. An additional 5–15\% of variance is gained from the lower free troposphere from either convective detrainment or frequent intrusions of western United States biomass burning smoke. Generally, aerosol particles were contained below the 0°C level, a common level of stability in convective regimes. However, occasional strong injections of smoke to the upper troposphere were also observed, accounting for the remaining 10–15\% variability in AOT. Examples of these common modes of variability in frontal and convective regimes are presented, demonstrating why AOT often has only a weak relationship to surface PM2.5 concentration.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper reviews the current knowledge of the climatological, structural, and organizational aspects of stratocumulus clouds and the physical processes controlling them. More of Earth’s surface is covered by stratocumulus clouds than by any other cloud type making them extremely important for Earth’s energy balance, primarily through their reflection of solar radiation. They are generally thin clouds, typically occupying the upper few hundred meters of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), and they preferably occur in shallow PBLs that are readily coupled by turbulent mixing to the surface moisture supply. Thus, stratocumuli favor conditions of strong lower-tropospheric stability, large-scale subsidence, and a ready supply of surface moisture; therefore, they are common over the cooler regions of subtropical and midlatitude oceans where their coverage can exceed 50\% in the annual mean. Convective instability in stratocumulus clouds is driven primarily by the emission of thermal infrared radiation from near the cloud tops and the resulting turbulence circulations are enhanced by latent heating in updrafts and cooling in downdrafts. Turbulent eddies and evaporative cooling drives entrainment at the top of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL), which is stronger than it would be in the absence of cloud, and this tends to result in a deepening of the STBL over time. Many stratocumulus clouds produce some drizzle through the collision–coalescence process, but thicker clouds drizzle more readily, which can lead to changes in the dynamics of the STBL that favor increased mesoscale variability, stratification of the STBL, and in some cases cloud breakup. Feedbacks between radiative cooling, precipitation formation, turbulence, and entrainment help to regulate stratocumulus. Although stratocumulus is arguably the most well-understood cloud type, it continues to challenge understanding. Indeed, recent field studies demonstrate that marine stratocumulus precipitate more strongly, and entrain less, than was previously thought, and display an organizational complexity much larger than previously imagined. Stratocumulus clouds break up as the STBL deepens and it becomes more difficult to maintain buoyant production of turbulence through the entire depth of the STBL. Stratocumulus cloud properties are sensitive to the concentration of aerosol particles and therefore anthropogenic pollution. For a given cloud thickness, polluted clouds tend to produce more numerous and smaller cloud droplets, greater cloud albedo, and drizzle suppression. In addition, cloud droplet size also affects the time scale for evaporation–entrainment interactions and sedimentation rate, which together with precipitation changes can affect turbulence and entrainment. Aerosols are themselves strongly modified by physical processes in stratocumuli, and these two-way interactions may be a key driver of aerosol concentrations over the remote oceans. Aerosol–stratocumulus interactions are therefore one of the most challenging frontiers in cloud–climate research. Low-cloud feedbacks are also a leading cause of uncertainty in future climate prediction because even small changes in cloud coverage and thickness have a major impact on the radiation budget. Stratocumuli remain challenging to represent in climate models since their controlling processes occur on such small scales. A better understanding of stratocumulus dynamics, particularly entrainment processes and mesoscale variability, will be required to constrain these feedbacks.

	abstract = {Abstract. The radiative forcing from aerosols (particularly through their interaction with clouds) remains one of the most uncertain components of the human forcing of the climate. Observation-based studies have typically found a smaller aerosol effective radiative forcing than in model simulations and were given preferential weighting in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). With their own sources of uncertainty, it is not clear that observation-based estimates are more reliable. Understanding the source of the model and observational differences is thus vital to reduce uncertainty in the impact of aerosols on the climate. These reported discrepancies arise from the different methods of separating the components of aerosol forcing used in model and observational studies. Applying the observational decomposition to global climate model (GCM) output, the two different lines of evidence are surprisingly similar, with a much better agreement on the magnitude of aerosol impacts on cloud properties. Cloud adjustments remain a significant source of uncertainty, particularly for ice clouds. However, they are consistent with the uncertainty from observation-based methods, with the liquid water path adjustment usually enhancing the Twomey effect by less than 50 \%. Depending on different sets of assumptions, this work suggests that model and observation-based estimates could be more equally weighted in future synthesis studies.},

	abstract = {Many global aerosol and climate models, including the widely used Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), have large biases in predicting aerosols in remote regions such as the upper troposphere and high latitudes. In this study, we conduct CAM5 sensitivity simulations to understand the role of key processes associated with aerosol transformation and wet removal affecting the vertical and horizontal long-range transport of aerosols to the remote regions. Improvements are made to processes that are currently not well represented in CAM5, which are guided by surface and aircraft measurements together with results from a multi-scale aerosol–climate model that explicitly represents convection and aerosol–cloud interactions at cloud-resolving scales. We pay particular attention to black carbon (BC) due to its importance in the Earth system and the availability of measurements. We introduce into CAM5 a new unified scheme for convective transport and aerosol wet removal with explicit aerosol activation above convective cloud base. This new implementation reduces the excessive BC aloft to better simulate observed BC profiles that show decreasing mixing ratios in the mid- to upper-troposphere. After implementing this new unified convective scheme, we examine wet removal of submicron aerosols that occurs primarily through cloud processes. The wet removal depends strongly on the subgrid-scale liquid cloud fraction and the rate of conversion of liquid water to precipitation. These processes lead to very strong wet removal of BC and other aerosols over mid- to high latitudes during winter months. With our improvements, the Arctic BC burden has a 10-fold (5-fold) increase in the winter (summer) months, resulting in a much-better simulation of the BC seasonal cycle as well. Arctic sulphate and other aerosol species also increase but to a lesser extent. An explicit treatment of BC aging with slower aging assumptions produces an additional 30-fold (5-fold) increase in the Arctic winter (summer) BC burden. This BC aging treatment, however, has minimal effect on other underpredicted species. Interestingly, our modifications to CAM5 that aim at improving prediction of high-latitude and upper-tropospheric aerosols also produce much-better aerosol optical depth (AOD) over various other regions globally when compared to multi-year AERONET retrievals. The improved aerosol distributions have impacts on other aspects of CAM5, improving the simulation of global mean liquid water path and cloud forcing.},

A similar relation was found on Graciosa Island but with greater scatter and weaker correlation presumably due to the island effect. Based on the relation, we are able to estimate the cloud base updrafts using a simple formula: Wb = −0.44 × CTRC + 22.30 ± 13, where the Wb and CTRC have units of cm/s and W/m2, respectively. This quantification can be utilized in satellite remote sensing and parameterizations of Wb in general circulation models.},

These histograms were generated by the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) simulator that was incorporated into doubled-CO2 simulations from 11 global climate models in the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project. The authors use a radiative transfer model to compute top of atmosphere flux sensitivities to cloud fraction perturbations in each bin of the histogram for each month and latitude. Multiplying these cloud radiative kernels with histograms of modeled cloud fraction changes at each grid point per unit of global warming produces an estimate of cloud feedback. Spatial structures and globally integrated cloud feedbacks computed in this manner agree remarkably well with the adjusted change in cloud radiative forcing. The global and annual mean model-simulated cloud feedback is dominated by contributions from medium thickness (3.6 {\textless} τ ≤ 23) cloud changes, but thick (τ {\textgreater} 23) cloud changes cause the rapid transition of cloud feedback values from positive in midlatitudes to negative poleward of 50°S and 70°N. High (CTP ≤ 440 hPa) cloud changes are the dominant contributor to longwave (LW) cloud feedback, but because their LW and shortwave (SW) impacts are in opposition, they contribute less to the net cloud feedback than do the positive contributions from low (CTP {\textgreater} 680 hPa) cloud changes. Midlevel (440 {\textless} CTP ≤ 680 hPa) cloud changes cause positive SW cloud feedbacks that are 80\% as large as those due to low clouds. Finally, high cloud changes induce wider ranges of LW and SW cloud feedbacks across models than do low clouds.},

	abstract = {Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is a powerful approach in identifying which inputs or parameters most affect a model's output. This determines which inputs to include when performing model calibration or uncertainty analysis. GSA allows quantification of the sensitivity index (SI) of a particular input – the percentage of the total variability in the output attributed to the changes in that input – by averaging over the other inputs rather than fixing them at specific values. Traditional methods of computing the SIs using the Sobol and extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (eFAST) methods involve running a model thousands of times, but this may not be feasible for computationally expensive Earth system models. GSA methods that use a statistical emulator in place of the expensive model are popular, as they require far fewer model runs. We performed an eight-input GSA, using the Sobol and eFAST methods, on two computationally expensive atmospheric chemical transport models using emulators that were trained with 80 runs of the models. We considered two methods to further reduce the computational cost of GSA: (1) a dimension reduction approach and (2) an emulator-free approach. When the output of a model is multi-dimensional, it is common practice to build a separate emulator for each dimension of the output space. Here, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the output dimension, built an emulator for each of the transformed outputs, and then computed SIs of the reconstructed output using the Sobol method. We considered the global distribution of the annual column mean lifetime of atmospheric methane, which requires ∼ 2000 emulators without PCA but only 5–40 emulators with PCA. We also applied an emulator-free method using a generalised additive model (GAM) to estimate the SIs using only the training runs. Compared to the emulator-only methods, the emulator–PCA and GAM methods accurately estimated the SIs of the ∼ 2000 methane lifetime outputs but were on average 24 and 37 times faster, respectively.},

The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved.

However, their accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models (NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.},

Between 45° and 60°S, the mean observed shortwave feedback (−0.91 ± 0.82 W m−2 K−1, relative to local rather than global mean warming) is very close to the multimodel mean feedback in RCP8.5 (−0.98 W m−2 K−1), despite differences in the meridional structure. In models, historical temperature-cloud property relationships reliably predict the forced RCP8.5 response. Because simple theory predicts this optical thickening with warming, and cloud amount changes are relatively small, we conclude that the shortwave cloud feedback is very likely negative in the real world at middle to high latitudes.},

In 1997, Kiehl and Trenberth provided a review of past estimates and performed a number of radiative computations to better establish the role of clouds and various greenhouse gases in the overall radiative energy flows, with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) values constrained by Earth Radiation Budget Experiment values from 1985 to 1989, when the TOA values were approximately in balance. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) measurements from March 2000 to May 2004 are used at TOA but adjusted to an estimated imbalance from the enhanced greenhouse effect of 0.9 W m−2. Revised estimates of surface turbulent fluxes are made based on various sources. The partitioning of solar radiation in the atmosphere is based in part on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) FD computations that utilize the global ISCCP cloud data every 3 h, and also accounts for increased atmospheric absorption by water vapor and aerosols. Surface upward longwave radiation is adjusted to account for spatial and temporal variability. A lack of closure in the energy balance at the surface is accommodated by making modest changes to surface fluxes, with the downward longwave radiation as the main residual to ensure a balance. Values are also presented for the land and ocean domains that include a net transport of energy from ocean to land of 2.2 petawatts (PW) of which 3.2 PW is from moisture (latent energy) transport, while net dry static energy transport is from land to ocean.

Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling reduces the computational cost by fusing different simulation outputs. Cheap data generated from low-fidelity simulators can be combined with limited high-quality data generated by an expensive high-fidelity simulator. Existing methods based on Gaussian processes rely on strong assumptions of the kernel functions and can hardly scale to high-dimensional settings. We propose Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes (MF-HNP), a unified neural latent variable model for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. MF-HNP inherits the flexibility and scalability of Neural Processes. The latent variables transform the correlations among different fidelity levels from observations to latent space. The predictions across fidelities are conditionally independent given the latent states. It helps alleviate the error propagation issue in existing methods. MF-HNP is flexible enough to handle non-nested high dimensional data at different fidelity levels with varying input and output dimensions. We evaluate MF-HNP on epidemiology and climate modeling tasks, achieving competitive performance in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. In contrast to deep Gaussian Processes with only low-dimensional ({\textless} 10) tasks, our method shows great promise for speeding up high-dimensional complex simulations (over 7000 for epidemiology modeling and 45000 for climate modeling).},

Predictions are hampered by the large range of scales of interaction between various components that need to be captured. Observation systems (remote sensing, in situ) are increasingly being used to constrain predictions, but significant challenges exist, to some extent because of the large range of scales and the fact that the various measuring systems tend to address different scales. Fine-scale models represent clouds, aerosols, and aerosol−cloud interactions with high fidelity but do not include interactions with the larger scale and are therefore limited from a climatic point of view.

Extensive measurement data are needed to understand the atmospheric processes governing this vulnerability. Among these, data describing cloud formation potential are of particular interest, since the indirect effect of aerosols on the climate system is still poorly understood. In this paper we present, for the first time, size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) data obtained in the Arctic. The measurements were conducted during two periods in the summer of 2008: one in June and one in August, at the Zeppelin research station (78°54´ N, 11°53´ E) in Svalbard. Trajectory analysis indicates that during the measurement period in June 2008, air masses predominantly originated from the Arctic, whereas the measurements from August 2008 were influenced by mid-latitude air masses. CCN supersaturation (SS) spectra obtained on the 27 June, before size-resolved measurements were begun, and spectra from the 21 and 24 August, conducted before and after the measurement period, revealed similarities between the 2 months. From the ratio between CCN concentration and the total particle number concentration (CN) as a function of dry particle diameter (\textit{D}$_{\textrm{p}}$) at a SS of 0.4 \%, the activation diameter (\textit{D}$_{\textrm{50}}$), corresponding to CCN / CN = 0.50, was estimated. \textit{D}$_{\textrm{50}}$ was found to be 60 and 67 nm for the examined periods in June and August 2008, respectively. Corresponding \textit{D}$_{\textrm{50}}$ hygroscopicity parameter (\&amp;kappa;) values were estimated to be 0.4 and 0.3 for June and August 2008, respectively. These values can be compared to hygroscopicity values estimated from bulk chemical composition, where \&amp;kappa; was calculated to be 0.5 for both June and August 2008. While the agreement between the 2 months is reasonable, the difference in \&amp;kappa; between the different methods indicates a size dependence in the particle composition, which is likely explained by a higher fraction of inorganics in the bulk aerosol samples.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cloud feedback—the change in top-of-atmosphere radiative flux resulting from the cloud response to warming—constitutes by far the largest source of uncertainty in the climate response to CO2 forcing simulated by global climate models (GCMs). We review the main mechanisms for cloud feedbacks, and discuss their representation in climate models and the sources of intermodel spread. Global-mean cloud feedback in GCMs results from three main effects: (1) rising free-tropospheric clouds (a positive longwave effect); (2) decreasing tropical low cloud amount (a positive shortwave [SW] effect); (3) increasing high-latitude low cloud optical depth (a negative SW effect). These cloud responses simulated by GCMs are qualitatively supported by theory, high-resolution modeling, and observations. Rising high clouds are consistent with the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis, whereby enhanced upper-tropospheric radiative cooling causes anvil cloud tops to remain at a nearly fixed temperature as the atmosphere warms. Tropical low cloud amount decreases are driven by a delicate balance between the effects of vertical turbulent fluxes, radiative cooling, large-scale subsidence, and lower-tropospheric stability on the boundary-layer moisture budget. High-latitude low cloud optical depth increases are dominated by phase changes in mixed-phase clouds. The causes of intermodel spread in cloud feedback are discussed, focusing particularly on the role of unresolved parameterized processes such as cloud microphysics, turbulence, and convection.

Here we use a multivariate approach1,2 to identify two distinct externally forced fingerprints from multiple ensembles of Earth system model simulations. The leading fingerprint, FM1(x), is characterized by global warming, intensified wet–dry patterns3 and progressive large-scale continental aridification, largely driven by multidecadal increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The second fingerprint, FM2(x), captures a pronounced interhemispheric temperature contrast4,5, associated meridional shifts in the intertropical convergence zone6–9 and correlated anomalies in precipitation and aridity over California10, the Sahel11,12 and India. FM2(x) exhibits nonlinear temporal behaviour: the intertropical convergence zone moves southwards before 1975 in response to increases in hemispherically asymmetric sulfate aerosol emissions, and it shifts northwards after 1975 due to reduced sulfur dioxide emissions and the GHG-induced warming of Northern Hemisphere landmasses. Both fingerprints are statistically identifiable in observations of joint changes in temperature, rainfall and aridity during 1950–2014. We show that the reliable simulation of these changes requires combined forcing by GHGs, direct and indirect effects of aerosols, and large volcanic eruptions. Our results suggest that GHG-induced aridification may be modulated regionally by future reductions in sulfate aerosol emissions. Large-scale mechanisms causing regional drying are not well understood. Models and observational data reveal that human-caused changes in GHGs and aerosols led to detectable global and hemispheric signals in the joint behaviour of precipitation, temperature and aridity since the 1950s.},

In particular, it is unclear why the variance of wintertime near-surface temperatures on daily and synoptic time-scales is roughly twice as high over North America as over Eurasia. In this study, continental geometry’s role in shaping regional wintertime temperature variance is investigated using idealized climate model simulations run with mid-latitude continents of different shapes. An isolated, rectangular mid-latitude continent suggests that in the absence of other geographic features, the highest temperature variance will be located in the northwest of the continent, roughly co-located with the region of largest meridional temperature gradients and just north of the maximum near-surface wind speeds. Simulations with other geometries, mimicking key features of North America and Eurasia, investigate the impacts of continental length and width, sloping coastlines and inland bodies of water on regional temperature variance. The largest effect comes from tapering the northwest corner of the continent, similar to Eurasia, which substantially reduces the maximum temperature variance. Narrower continents have smaller temperature variance in isolation, implying that the high variances over North America must be due to the non-local influence of stationary waves. Support for this hypothesis is provided by simulations with two mid-latitude continents, which show how continental geometry and stationary waves can combine to shape regional temperature variance.},

The clean aerosol time periods, defined using the distribution of refractory black carbon number concentrations, increase in frequency from June through August as the anthropogenic influence dwindles. During the clean periods, the number concentrations of particles that can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) increase from June through August suggesting that DMS, and possibly other oceanic organic precursors, exert significant control on the Arctic summertime submicron aerosol, a proposition supported by simulations from the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS global chemical transport model with particle microphysics. The CCN increase for the clean periods across the summer is estimated to be able to increase cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) by 23–44 cm-3, comparable to the mean CDNC increase needed to yield the current global cloud albedo forcing from industrial aerosols. These results suggest that DMS may contribute significantly to modification of the Arctic summer shortwave cloud albedo, and they offer a reference for future changes in the Arctic summer aerosol.},

We estimate a probability density function for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and obtain a 5–95 per cent probability range of 2.4–5.4 °C. Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice.

	abstract = {An optimal linear filter (fingerprint) is derived for the detection of a given time-dependent, multivariate climate change signal in the presence of natural climate variability noise. Application of the fingerprint to the observed (or model simulated) climate data yields a climate change detection variable (detector) with maximal signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal fingerprint is given by the product of the assumed signal pattern and the inverse of the climate variability covariance matrix. The data can consist of any, not necessarily dynamically complete, climate dataset for which estimates of the natural variability covariance matrix exist. The single-pattern analysis readily generalizes to the multipattern case of a climate change signal lying in a prescribed (in practice relatively low dimensional) signal pattern space: the single-pattern result is simply applied separately to each individual base pattern spanning the signal pattern space. Multipattern detection methods can be applied either to test the statistical significance of individual components of a predicted multicomponent climate change response, using separate single-pattern detection tests, or to determine the statistical significance of the complete signal, using a multivariate test. Both detection modes make use of the same set of detectors. The difference in direction of the assumed signal pattern and computed optimal fingerprint vector allows alternative interpretations of the estimated signal associated with the set of optimal detectors. The present analysis yields an estimated signal lying in the assumed signal space, whereas an earlier analysis of the time-independent detection problem by Hasselmann yielded an estimated signal in the computed fingerprint space. The different interpretations can be explained by different choices of the metric used to relate the signal space to the fingerprint space (inverse covariance matrix versus standard Euclidean metric, respectively). Two simple natural variability models are considered: a space-time separability model, and an expansion in terms of P0Ps (principal oscillation patterns). For each model the application of the optimal fingerprint method is illustrated by an example.},

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

However, we find that clouds are surrounded by a “twilight zone” – a belt of forming and evaporating cloud fragments and hydrated aerosols extending tens of kilometers from the clouds into the so-called cloud-free zone. The gradual transition from cloudy to dry atmosphere is proportional to the aerosol loading, suggesting an additional aerosol effect on the composition and radiation fluxes of the atmosphere. Using AERONET data, we find that the measured aerosol optical depth is higher by 13\% ± 2\% in the visible and 22\% ± 2\% in the NIR in measurements taken near clouds relative to its value in the measurements taken before or after, and that 30\%−60\% of the free atmosphere is affected by this phenomenon.},

Understanding these changes in precipitation has proven particularly difficult for the case of absorbing aerosol, which absorbs a significant amount of incoming solar radiation and hence acts as a source of localized diabatic heating to the atmosphere. In this work, we use an ensemble of atmosphere-only climate model simulations forced by identical absorbing aerosol perturbations in different geographical locations across the globe to develop a basic physical understanding of how this localized heating impacts the atmosphere and how these changes impact on precipitation both globally and locally. In agreement with previous studies we find that absorbing aerosol causes a decrease in global-mean precipitation, but we also show that even for identical aerosol optical depth perturbations, the global-mean precipitation change varies by over an order-of-magnitude depending on the location of the aerosol burden. Our experiments also demonstrate that the local precipitation response to absorbing aerosol is opposite in sign between the tropics and the extratropics, as found by previous work. We then show that this contrasting response can be understood in terms of different mechanisms by which the large-scale circulation responds to heating in the extratropics and in the tropics. We provide a simple theory to explain variations in the local precipitation response to absorbing aerosol in the tropics. Our work highlights that the spatial pattern of absorbing aerosol and its interactions with circulation are a key determinant of its overall climate impact and must be taken into account when developing our understanding of aerosol-climate interactions.},

	abstract = {Interactions between aerosol particles and clouds contribute a great deal of uncertainty to the scientific community's understanding of anthropogenic climate forcing. Aerosol particles serve as the nucleation sites for cloud droplets, establishing a direct linkage between anthropogenic particulate emissions and clouds in the climate system. To resolve this linkage, the community has developed parameterizations of aerosol activation which can be used in global climate models to interactively predict cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs). However, different activation schemes can exhibit different sensitivities to aerosol perturbations in different meteorological or pollution regimes. To assess the impact these different sensitivities have on climate forcing, we have coupled three different core activation schemes and variants with the CESM-MARC (two-Moment, Multi-Modal, Mixing-state-resolving Aerosol model for Research of Climate (MARC) coupled with the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM; version 1.2)). Although the model produces a reasonable present-day CDNC climatology when compared with observations regardless of the scheme used, ΔCDNCs between the present and preindustrial era regionally increase by over 100 \% in zonal mean when using the most sensitive parameterization. These differences in activation sensitivity may lead to a different evolution of the model meteorology, and ultimately to a spread of over 0.8 Wm-2 in global average shortwave indirect effect (AIE) diagnosed from the model, a range which is as large as the inter-model spread from the AeroCom intercomparison. Model-derived AIE strongly scales with the simulated preindustrial CDNC burden, and those models with the greatest preindustrial CDNC tend to have the smallest AIE, regardless of their ΔCDNC. This suggests that present-day evaluations of aerosol-climate models may not provide useful constraints on the magnitude of the AIE, which will arise from differences in model estimates of the preindustrial aerosol and cloud climatology.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate models often exhibit spurious long-term changes independent of either internal variability or changes to external forcing. Such changes, referred to as model “drift,” may distort the estimate of forced change in transient climate simulations. The importance of drift is examined in comparison to historical trends over recent decades in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Comparison based on a selection of metrics suggests a significant overall reduction in the magnitude of drift from phase 3 of CMIP (CMIP3) to phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5). The direction of both ocean and atmospheric drift is systematically biased in some models introducing statistically significant drift in globally averaged metrics. Nevertheless, for most models globally averaged drift remains weak compared to the associated forced trends and is often smaller than the difference between trends derived from different ensemble members or the error introduced by the aliasing of natural variability. An exception to this is metrics that include the deep ocean (e.g., steric sea level) where drift can dominate in forced simulations. In such circumstances drift must be corrected for using information from concurrent control experiments. Many CMIP5 models now include ocean biogeochemistry. Like physical models, biogeochemical models generally undergo long spinup integrations to minimize drift. Nevertheless, based on a limited subset of models, it is found that drift is an important consideration and must be accounted for. For properties or regions where drift is important, the drift correction method must be carefully considered. The use of a drift estimate based on the full control time series is recommended to minimize the contamination of the drift estimate by internal variability.},

Scanning electron microscopy was utilised to derive size-segregated particle compositions and size distributions, and these were compared to corresponding data from wing-mounted optical particle counters. Reasonable agreement between the calculated number size distributions was found. Significant variability in composition was observed, with differing external and internal mixing identified, between air mass trajectory cases based on HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) analyses. Dominant particle classes were silicate-based dusts and sea salts, with particles notably rich in K and Ca detected in one case. Source regions varied from the Arctic Ocean and Greenland through to northern Russia and the European continent. Good agreement between the back trajectories was mirrored by comparable compositional trends between samples. Silicate dusts were identified in all cases, and the elemental composition of the dust was consistent for all samples except one. It is hypothesised that long-range, high-altitude transport was primarily responsible for this dust, with likely sources including the Asian arid regions.},

Because it is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) user facility, ARM data are freely available to anyone through the ARM Data Archive. With 20 years of operations, the facility recently added two mobile facilities and an aerial facility to its network of fixed-location sites. Research using ARM data has led to advances in areas ranging from radiative transfer to cloud microphysics. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allowed ARM to enhance its observational capabilities with a broad array of new instruments at its fixed and mobile sites and the aerial facility. Instruments include scanning radars; water vapor, cloud/aerosol extinction, and Doppler lidars; aerosol instruments for measuring optical, physical, and chemical properties; and aircraft probes for measuring cloud and aerosol properties. Taking full advantage of these instruments will involve the development of complex data products. This work is underway but will benefit from engagement with the broader scientific community. This article describes the current status of the ARM research capabilities with an emphasis on developments over the past eight years since ARM was designated a DOE scientific user facility, reviews some of scientific advances made using the ARM Facility over the past two decades, and describes the new measurement capabilities and adaptations of the ARM facility to make effective use of these capabilities.},

In M7 the aerosol population is divided into two types of particles: mixed, or water-soluble particles, and insoluble particles. The particles are represented by seven classes, using a “pseudomodal” approach. Four classes are for the mixed particles representing nucleation, Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode, and three are for the insoluble (Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode). The components considered are mineral dust, black carbon (BC) and primary organic carbon (OC), sulfate, and sea salt. The aerosol dynamic processes in M7 include nucleation, coagulation, and condensation of sulfuric acid. Mixed particles are formed from insoluble particles by coagulation and condensation. The integration scheme is computationally very efficient. The model has been tested against the analytical solution and a sectional model for the formation of SO4/BC mixed particles, evaluating the mixing by condensation and coagulation. Furthermore, M7 has been run in free tropospheric conditions and compared to aircraft observations. M7 has proven to be accurate and fast enough to be included in a GCM or CTM.},

	abstract = {A diagnostic cloud nucleation scavenging scheme, which determines stratiform cloud scavenging ratios for both aerosol mass and number distributions, based on cloud droplet, and ice crystal number concentrations, is introduced into the ECHAM5-HAM global climate model. This scheme is coupled with a size-dependent in-cloud impaction scavenging parameterization for both cloud droplet-aerosol, and ice crystal-aerosol collisions. The aerosol mass scavenged in stratiform clouds is found to be primarily ({\textgreater}90\%) scavenged by cloud nucleation processes for all aerosol species, except for dust (50\%). The aerosol number scavenged is primarily ({\textgreater}90\%) attributed to impaction. 99\% of this impaction scavenging occurs in clouds with temperatures less than 273 K. Sensitivity studies are presented, which compare aerosol concentrations, burdens, and deposition for a variety of in-cloud scavenging approaches: prescribed fractions, a more computationally expensive prognostic aerosol cloud processing treatment, and the new diagnostic scheme, also with modified assumptions about in-cloud impaction and nucleation scavenging. Our results show that while uncertainties in the representation of in-cloud scavenging processes can lead to differences in the range of 20–30\% for the predicted annual, global mean aerosol mass burdens, and near to 50\% for accumulation mode aerosol number burden, the differences in predicted aerosol mass concentrations can be up to one order of magnitude, particularly for regions of the middle troposphere with temperatures below 273 K where mixed and ice phase clouds exist. Different parameterizations for impaction scavenging changed the predicted global, annual mean number removal attributed to ice clouds by seven-fold, and the global, annual dust mass removal attributed to impaction by two orders of magnitude. Closer agreement with observations of black carbon profiles from aircraft (increases near to one order of magnitude for mixed phase clouds), mid-troposphere 210Pb vertical profiles, and the geographic distribution of aerosol optical depth is found for the new diagnostic scavenging scheme compared to the prescribed scavenging fraction scheme of the standard ECHAM5-HAM. The diagnostic and prognostic schemes represent the variability of scavenged fractions particularly for submicron size aerosols, and for mixed and ice phase clouds, and are recommended in preference to the prescribed scavenging fractions method.},

	abstract = {Machine learning approaches, such as random forests (RF), have been used to effectively emulate various aspects of climate and weather models in recent years. The limitations to these approaches are not yet known, particularly with regards to varying complexity of the underlying physical parameterization scheme within the climate model. Utilizing a hierarchy of model configurations, we explore the limits of random forest emulator skill using simplified model frameworks within NCAR's Community Atmosphere Model, version 6 (CAM6). These include a dry CAM6 configuration, a moist extension of the dry model, and an extension of the moist case that includes an additional convection scheme. Each model configuration is run with identical resolution and over the same time period. With unique RF being optimized for each tendency or precipitation rate across the hierarchy, we create a variety of “best case” emulators. The random forest emulators are then evaluated against the CAM6 output as well as a baseline neural network emulator for completeness. All emulators show significant skill when compared to the “truth” (CAM6), often in line with or exceeding similar approaches within the literature. In addition, as the CAM6 complexity is increased, the random forest skill noticeably decreases, regardless of the extensive tuning and training process each random forest goes through. This indicates a limit on the feasibility of RF to act as physics emulators in climate models and encourages further exploration in order to identify ideal uses in the context of state‐of‐the‐art climate model configurations. Machine learning (ML) has become an intriguing technique for replacing complicated aspects of climate and weather models, processes such as cloud interactions and rain are examples of this. However, the limitations of various ML techniques are not yet fully understood. We explore these limits, focusing on a specific ML method and utilizing simplified climate modeling frameworks. The ML models are then carefully analyzed against the original climate model results and results from a standard baseline ML approach. All of our machine learned models show impressive skill at recreating the original results. However, that skill is shown to noticeably decrease as the complexity of the climate model framework is increased. While this may be expected, it is useful for understanding limits on the feasibility of certain ML techniques to be used within state‐of‐the‐art climate models. Further investigation is needed to understand the viability and best use‐cases of these methods being adopted into simulating of the Earth system. Random forests (RF) skillfully emulate simple physics schemes within the Community Atmosphere Model in an offline state Hierarchical approach shows both qualitative and quantitative decreases in skill of RF as complexity increases In the case of 2‐dimensional precipitation fields, random forest skill is in‐line with baseline neural network performance Random forests (RF) skillfully emulate simple physics schemes within the Community Atmosphere Model in an offline state Hierarchical approach shows both qualitative and quantitative decreases in skill of RF as complexity increases In the case of 2‐dimensional precipitation fields, random forest skill is in‐line with baseline neural network performance},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent research that assesses evidence for the detection of anthropogenic and natural external influences on the climate. Externally driven climate change has been detected by a number of investigators in independent data covering many parts of the climate system, including surface temperature on global and large regional scales, ocean heat content, atmospheric circulation, and variables of the free atmosphere, such as atmospheric temperature and tropopause height. The influence of external forcing is also clearly discernible in reconstructions of hemispheric-scale temperature of the last millennium. These observed climate changes are very unlikely to be due only to natural internal climate variability, and they are consistent with the responses to anthropogenic and natural external forcing of the climate system that are simulated with climate models. The evidence indicates that natural drivers such as solar variability and volcanic activity are at most partially responsible for the large-scale temperature changes observed over the past century, and that a large fraction of the warming over the last 50 yr can be attributed to greenhouse gas increases. Thus, the recent research supports and strengthens the IPCC Third Assessment Report conclusion that “most of the global warming over the past 50 years is likely due to the increase in greenhouse gases.”},

	abstract = {A cloud-resolving model (CRM) coupled to a new intermediate-complexity bulk aerosol scheme is used to study aerosol–boundary-layer–cloud–precipitation interactions and the development of pockets of open cells (POCs) in subtropical stratocumulus cloud layers. The aerosol scheme prognoses mass and number concentration of a single lognormal accumulation mode with surface and entrainment sources, evolving subject to processing of activated aerosol and scavenging of dry aerosol by clouds and rain. The CRM with the aerosol scheme is applied to a range of steadily forced cases idealized from a well-observed POC. The long-term system evolution is explored with extended two-dimensional (2-D) simulations of up to 20 days, mostly with diurnally averaged insolation and 24 km wide domains, and one 10 day three-dimensional (3-D) simulation. Both 2-D and 3-D simulations support the Baker–Charlson hypothesis of two distinct aerosol–cloud "regimes" (deep/high-aerosol/non-drizzling and shallow/low-aerosol/drizzling) that persist for days; transitions between these regimes, driven by either precipitation scavenging or aerosol entrainment from the free-troposphere (FT), occur on a timescale of ten hours. The system is analyzed using a two-dimensional phase plane with inversion height and boundary layer average aerosol concentrations as state variables; depending on the specified subsidence rate and availability of FT aerosol, these regimes are either stable equilibria or distinct legs of a slow limit cycle. The same steadily forced modeling framework is applied to the coupled development and evolution of a POC and the surrounding overcast boundary layer in a larger 192 km wide domain. An initial 50\% aerosol reduction is applied to half of the model domain. This has little effect until the stratocumulus thickens enough to drizzle, at which time the low-aerosol portion transitions into open-cell convection, forming a POC. Reduced entrainment in the POC induces a negative feedback between the areal fraction covered by the POC and boundary layer depth changes. This stabilizes the system by controlling liquid water path and precipitation sinks of aerosol number in the overcast region, while also preventing boundary layer collapse within the POC, allowing the POC and overcast to coexist indefinitely in a quasi-steady equilibrium.},

Here results from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project are analyzed and it is shown that there is little relationship between and the warming trend in the early industrial period in comprehensive climate models. In particular, some models simulate a warming in the early industrial period despite a strong (very negative) . The reason for this difference in results is that the global-mean log-linear scaling of with anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions introduced and used by Stevens tends to produce a substantially larger aerosol forcing compared to climate models in the first half of the twentieth century, when SO2 emissions were concentrated over smaller regions. In turn, it shows smaller (less negative) in the recent period with comparatively more widespread SO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The 2015 Paris Agreement includes a two-headed temperature goal: “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 ∘C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 ∘C”. Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive overview of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between a 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C warming that are highly relevant for the assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 ∘C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 ∘C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 \% in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 \% by 2100 for a 1.5 ∘C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 \% to 17 \% between 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 to 11 \%. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels for a 2 ∘C scenario, and about 10 cm lower levels for a 1.5 ∘C scenario. In a 1.5 ∘C scenario, the rate of sea-level rise in 2100 would be reduced by about 30 \% compared to a 2 ∘C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess both future climate risks and different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a good basis for future work on refining our understanding of the difference between impacts at 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C warming.},

This is the first comparison with a chemical transport model of refractory BC (rBC) measurements at Alert. The springtime airborne measurements performed by the NETCARE campaign in 2015 and the PAMARCMiP campaigns in 2009 and 2011 offer BC vertical profiles extending to above 6 km across the Arctic and include profiles above Arctic ground monitoring stations. Our simulations with the addition of seasonally varying domestic heating and of gas flaring emissions are consistent with ground-based measurements of BC concentrations at Alert and Barrow in winter and spring (rRMSE  {\textless} 13 \%) and with airborne measurements of the BC vertical profile across the Arctic (rRMSE  = 17 \%) except for an underestimation in the middle troposphere (500–700 hPa).Sensitivity simulations suggest that anthropogenic emissions in eastern and southern Asia have the largest effect on the Arctic BC column burden both in spring (56 \%) and annually (37 \%), with the largest contribution in the middle troposphere (400–700 hPa). Anthropogenic emissions from northern Asia contribute considerable BC (27 \% in spring and 43 \% annually) to the lower troposphere (below 900 hPa). Biomass burning contributes 20 \% to the Arctic BC column annually.At the Arctic surface, anthropogenic emissions from northern Asia (40–45 \%) and eastern and southern Asia (20–40 \%) are the largest BC contributors in winter and spring, followed by Europe (16–36 \%). Biomass burning from North America is the most important contributor to all stations in summer, especially at Barrow.Our adjoint simulations indicate pronounced spatial heterogeneity in the contribution of emissions to the Arctic BC column concentrations, with noteworthy contributions from emissions in eastern China (15 \%) and western Siberia (6.5 \%). Although uncertain, gas flaring emissions from oilfields in western Siberia could have a striking impact (13 \%) on Arctic BC loadings in January, comparable to the total influence of continental Europe and North America (6.5 \% each in January).

	abstract = {Global warming drives changes in Earth’s cloud cover, which, in turn, may amplify or dampen climate change. This “cloud feedback” is the single most important cause of uncertainty in Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS)—the equilibrium global warming following a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Using data from Earth observations and climate model simulations, we here develop a statistical learning analysis of how clouds respond to changes in the environment. We show that global cloud feedback is dominated by the sensitivity of clouds to surface temperature and tropospheric stability. Considering changes in just these two factors, we are able to constrain global cloud feedback to 0.43 ± 0.35 W⋅m−2⋅K−1 (90\% confidence), implying a robustly amplifying effect of clouds on global warming and only a 0.5\% chance of ECS below 2 K. We thus anticipate that our approach will enable tighter constraints on climate change projections, including its manifold socioeconomic and ecological impacts.},

	abstract = {We design a new strategy to load‐balance high‐intensity sub‐grid atmospheric physics calculations restricted to a small fraction of a global climate simulation's domain. We show why the current parallel load balancing infrastructure of Community Earth System Model (CESM) and Energy Exascale Earth Model (E3SM) cannot efficiently handle this scenario at large core counts. As an example, we study an unusual configuration of the E3SM Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF) that embeds a binary mixture of two separate cloud‐resolving model grid structures that is attractive for low cloud feedback studies. Less than a third of the planet uses high‐resolution (MMF‐HR; sub‐km horizontal grid spacing) relative to standard low‐resolution (MMF‐LR) cloud superparameterization elsewhere. To enable MMF runs with Multi‐Domain cloud resolving models (CRMs), our load balancing theory predicts the most efficient computational scale as a function of the high‐intensity work's relative overhead and its fractional coverage. The scheme successfully maximizes model throughput and minimizes model cost relative to precursor infrastructure, effectively by devoting the vast majority of the processor pool to operate on the few high‐intensity (and rate‐limiting) high‐resolution (HR) grid columns. Two examples prove the concept, showing that minor artifacts can be introduced near the HR/low‐resolution CRM grid transition boundary on idealized aquaplanets, but are minimal in operationally relevant real‐geography settings. As intended, within the high (low) resolution area, our Multi‐Domain CRM simulations exhibit cloud fraction and shortwave reflection convergent to standard baseline tests that use globally homogenous MMF‐LR and MMF‐HR. We suggest this approach can open up a range of creative multi‐resolution climate experiments without requiring unduly large allocations of computational resources. The atmospheric physics parameterizations of traditional climate models do not spend radically different amounts of computational power and time across different parts of the globe. However, there are some physical processes, such as low cloud formation, that require much higher resolution than we currently use to model climate change. Using the traditional framework, this becomes too expensive because of computational limitations. In this work, we develop a way to efficiently enhance the interior resolution of a multi‐scale climate model over only parts of the world. Specifically, we develop a way for a supercomputer to best split up the work of simulating the cloud physics over the parts of the world with coarser versus higher resolution so that it runs much faster. We also show that this task of using coarse resolution in some places and high resolution in others doesn't produce unwanted side effects.

It is therefore crucial to find low dimensional summaries which are informative about the parameter inference or model choice task at hand. This chapter reviews the methods which have been proposed to select such summaries, extending the previous review paper of Blum et al. (2013) with recent developments.

The DC‐8 employed 23 in situ and five remote sensing instruments for radiation, chemistry, and microphysics. The Learjet used 11 instruments to explore cloud microphysics. SEAC4RS launched numerous balloons, augmented AErosol RObotic NETwork, and collaborated with many existing ground measurement sites. Flights investigating convection included close coordination of all three aircraft. Coordinated DC‐8 and ER‐2 flights investigated the optical properties of aerosols, the influence of aerosols on clouds, and the performance of new instruments for satellite measurements of clouds and aerosols. ER‐2 sorties sampled stratospheric injections of water vapor and other chemicals by local and distant convection. DC‐8 flights studied seasonally evolving chemistry in the Southeastern U.S., atmospheric chemistry with lower emissions of NOx and SO2 than in previous decades, isoprene chemistry under high and low NOx conditions at different locations, organic aerosols, air pollution near Houston and in petroleum fields, smoke from wildfires in western forests and from agricultural fires in the Mississippi Valley, and the ways in which the chemistry in the boundary layer and the upper troposphere were influenced by vertical transport in convective clouds.

Atmospheric energy budgets are calculated for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways using ScenarioMIP projections from Phase 6 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project and are used to quantify the influence of 21st century aerosol cleanup on precipitation. Absorbing aerosol influences on shortwave absorption are isolated from the effects of water vapor. Apparent hydrologic sensitivity is ∼40\% higher for the Middle of the Road (SSP2‐4.5) scenario with aerosol cleanup than for the Regional Rivalry (SSP3‐7.0) scenario that maintains aerosol. Regionally, cleanup‐induced changes in the atmospheric energy budget are of a similar magnitude to the precipitation increases themselves and are larger than the influence of changes in atmospheric circulation. Policy choices about future absorbing aerosol emissions will therefore have major impacts on global and regional precipitation changes. Precipitation changes will have a temperature‐dependent and a temperature‐independent part of their response to climate change. Water vapor contributes primarily to the former while well‐mixed greenhouse gases will influence both. The temperature‐independent response will be impacted by absorbing aerosol emissions. This is examined through an atmospheric energy budget where precipitation (i.e., latent heat) balances other energy sources and sinks in the atmosphere (i.e., sensible heat and shortwave and longwave radiation). We utilize a novel set of global climate model simulations that incorporate varied socioeconomic choices over the 21st century to study real‐world implications of future aerosol policies on precipitation. Reductions in absorbing aerosol amount help precipitation to increase because less shortwave absorption will occur in the atmosphere and, on average, other energy contributions do not change per degree warming. Global precipitation change per degree of global warming is ∼40\% higher for socioeconomic pathways where aerosol cleanup occurs. Regional precipitation changes associated with regional aerosol changes are larger than those associated with changes in atmospheric circulation. Policy choices for aerosol emissions will thus have a critical impact on the future availability of water, both globally and regionally.

Prognostic variables include cloud droplet and cloud ice mass mixing ratios and number concentrations. The scheme treats several microphysical processes, including hydrometeor collection, condensation/evaporation, freezing, melting, and sedimentation. The activation of droplets on aerosol is physically based and coupled to a subgrid vertical velocity. Unique aspects of the scheme, relative to existing two-moment schemes developed for general circulation models, are the diagnostic treatment of rain and snow number concentration and mixing ratio and the explicit treatment of subgrid cloud water variability for calculation of the microphysical process rates. Numerical aspects of the scheme are described in detail using idealized one-dimensional offline tests of the microphysics. Sensitivity of the scheme to time step, vertical resolution, and numerical method for diagnostic precipitation is investigated over a range of conditions. It is found that, in general, two substeps are required for numerical stability and reasonably small time truncation errors using a time step of 20 min; however, substepping is only required for the precipitation microphysical processes rather than the entire scheme. A new numerical approach for the diagnostic rain and snow produces reasonable results compared to a benchmark simulation, especially at low vertical resolution.

The simulated production of aerosol number (1.4 × 106 m−2 s−1) and OCaer (29 Tg C y−1) fall near the upper end of published estimates and suggest that primary marine aerosols may have greater influences on the physicochemical evolution of the troposphere, radiative transfer and climate, and associated feedbacks on the surface ocean than suggested by previous model studies.},

	abstract = {Fifty years ago, Joseph Smagorinsky published a landmark paper ([ 1 ][1]) describing numerical experiments using the primitive equations (a set of fluid equations that describe global atmospheric flows). In so doing, he introduced what later became known as a General Circulation Model (GCM). GCMs have come to provide a compelling framework for coupling the atmospheric circulation to a great variety of processes. Although early GCMs could only consider a small subset of these processes, it was widely appreciated that a more comprehensive treatment was necessary to adequately represent the drivers of the circulation. But how comprehensive this treatment must be was unclear and, as Smagorinsky realized ([ 2 ][2]), could only be determined through numerical experimentation. These types of experiments have since shown that an adequate description of basic processes like cloud formation, moist convection, and mixing is what climate models miss most.

Smagorinsky's GCM was designed around the premise that studies of the general circulation required a model capable of resolving the heat transport from the equator to the poles. Its formulation was the next logical step in a program of hierarchical model development best known for its pioneering contributions to numerical weather prediction ([ 3 ][3]). The work paved the way for fundamental studies of the atmospheric general circulation, and hence Earth's climate.

Over the past half century, many of these studies have focused on the types of numerical experiments anticipated by Smagorinsky. Beginning with basic processes like moist convection and cloud formation, which have long been appreciated as central to the energetics of the troposphere, a long succession of processes and couplings have been added to primitive-equation descriptions of the atmospheric general circulation. In so doing, GCMs have gradually morphed into Global Climate Models, and with the more recent incorporation of models of the biosphere and the associated cycles of important chemical nutrients, Earth System Models ([ 4 ][4], [ 5 ][5]).

![Figure][6]{\textless}/img{\textgreater}

Wide variation.
The response patterns of clouds and precipitation to warming vary dramatically depending on the climate model, even in the simplest model configuration. Shown are changes in the radiative effects of clouds and in precipitation accompanying a uniform warming (4°C) predicted by four models from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) for a water planet with prescribed surface temperatures.



The increase in complexity has greatly expanded the scope of questions to which GCMs can be applied ([ 5 ][5]). Yet, it has had relatively little impact on key uncertainties that emerged in early studies with less comprehensive models ([ 6 ][7]). These uncertainties include the equilibrium climate sensitivity (that is, the global warming associated with a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide), arctic amplification of temperature changes, and regional precipitation responses. Rather than reducing biases stemming from an inadequate representation of basic processes, additional complexity has multiplied the ways in which these biases introduce uncertainties in climate simulations ([ 7 ][8], [ 8 ][9]).

For instance, a poor understanding of what controls the distribution of tropical precipitation over land, and hence vegetation dynamics, limits attempts to understand the carbon cycle ([ 9 ][10]). Similarly, uncertainties in arctic amplification of warming hinder predictions of permafrost melting and resultant changes in soil biogeochemistry.

Although the drive to complexity has not reduced key uncertainties, it has addressed Smagorinsky's question ([ 2 ][2]) as to what level of process detail is necessary to understand the general circulation. There is now ample evidence that an inadequate representation of clouds and moist convection, or more generally the coupling between atmospheric water and circulation, is the main limitation in current representations of the climate system.

That this limitation constitutes a major roadblock to progress in climate science can be illustrated by simple numerical experiments. In idealized simulations of a waterworld that neglect complex interactions among land surface, cryosphere, biosphere, and aerosol and chemical processes (see the figure), the key uncertainties associated with the response of clouds and precipitation to global warming are as large as they are in comprehensive Earth System Models ([ 10 ][11]).

Differences among the simulations in the figure are especially evident in the tropics, where the sign of cloud changes and the spatial structure of the precipitation response differ fundamentally between models. This diversity of responses arises because, at low latitudes, the coupling between water and circulation is disproportionately dependent on the representation of unresolved processes, such as moist convection and cloud formation ([ 11 ][12], [ 12 ][13]). The mid-latitudes show more robust responses because much of the energy transport is carried by baroclinic eddies; these, too, are fundamentally coupled to water, but they are much better described and resolved by modern GCMs, as foreseen by Smagorinsky ([ 1 ][1]).

The uncertain interplay between water and circulation that underlies differences in the response of the climate system to warming (see the figure) can be expressed in terms of more specific questions. For instance, how do marine boundary-layer clouds depend on their environment? Or how do atmospheric circulations couple to moist convection through surface and radiative fluxes? The first question ends up being key to explaining the intermodel spread in climate sensitivity ([ 13 ][14], [ 14 ][15]), the second to the pattern of the regional response to warming. Differences in regional responses also influence ocean circulations, and hence how oceans take up heat, as well as patterns of precipitation, and hence how the land biosphere takes up carbon.

A deeper understanding and better representation of the coupling between water and circulation, rather than a more expansive representation of the Earth System, is thus necessary to reduce the uncertainty in estimates of the climate sensitivity and to guide adaptation to climate change at the regional level. This knowledge should help focus efforts and lead to progress in reducing the imprecision of climate models in the next 50 years. Here, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) provides a good example. By focusing on key limitations in the model initialization, spatial resolution, and the representation of key parameterized processes, NWP has improved forecast skill substantially over the past 30 years ([ 15 ][16]).

It is time to draw lessons from the era of experimentation that Smagorinsky launched half a century ago, and focus climate modeling efforts on advancing understanding and improving the numerical representations of how clouds, moist convection, and heating couple to the general circulation.

2.  [↵][20] In ([ 1 ][1]), Smagorinsky concluded: "In pursuing the objective to generalize theoretical models we must ask ourselves whether greater detail in formulating the contributing processes is warranted by truncation errors, by sensitivity of the results to detail, by the resulting increase in computational complexity and time, and by ignorance of the way these processes really work. Very often this cannot be determined in advance, but must wait for computational experiments to be performed.

	abstract = {Observations of Earth from space have been made for over 40 years and have contributed to advances in many aspects of climate science. However, attempts to exploit this wealth of data are often hampered by a lack of homogeneity and continuity and by insufficient understanding of the products and their uncertainties. There is, therefore, a need to reassess and reprocess satellite datasets to maximize their usefulness for climate science. The European Space Agency has responded to this need by establishing the Climate Change Initiative (CCI). The CCI will create new climate data records for (currently) 13 essential climate variables (ECVs) and make these open and easily accessible to all. Each ECV project works closely with users to produce time series from the available satellite observations relevant to users' needs. A climate modeling users' group provides a climate system perspective and a forum to bring the data and modeling communities together. This paper presents the CCI program. It outlines its benefit and presents approaches and challenges for each ECV project, covering clouds, aerosols, ozone, greenhouse gases, sea surface temperature, ocean color, sea level, sea ice, land cover, fire, glaciers, soil moisture, and ice sheets. It also discusses how the CCI approach may contribute to defining and shaping future developments in Earth observation for climate science.},

	abstract = {Global Bayesian optimization (GBO) is a derivative-free optimization method that is used widely in the tech-industry to optimize objective functions that are expensive to evaluate, numerically or otherwise. We discuss the use of GBO in ensemble data assimilation (DA), where the goal is to update the state of a numerical model in view of noisy observations. Specifically, we consider three tasks: (i) the estimation of model parameters; (ii) the tuning of localization and inflation in ensemble DA; (iii) doing both, i.e. estimating model parameters while simultaneously tuning the localization and inflation of the ensemble DA. For all three tasks, the GBO works ‘offline’, i.e. a set of ‘training’ observations are used within GBO to determine appropriate model or localization/inflation parameters, which are subsequently deployed within an ensemble DA system. Because of the offline nature of the technique, GBO can easily be combined with existing DA systems and it can effectively decouple (nearly) linear/Gaussian aspects of a problem from highly nonlinear/non-Gaussian ones. We illustrate the use of GBO in simple numerical experiments with the classical Lorenz problems. Our main goals are to introduce GBO in the context of ensemble DA and to spark an interest in GBO and its uses for streamlining important tasks in ensemble DA.},

Data were collected at a coastal surface site, and on an aircraft that flew north (upwind) of the surface site during the CLOUDYCOLUMN portion of the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE‐2). In a closure study we compare observations, from five study days, and predictions based on Köhler and parcel theory. Measured and predicted cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) do agree after accounting for differences between the mobility equivalent (Dme) and sphere equivalent (Dse) diameters, but only when considering results from two study days unaffected by continental pollution. After applying the Dme − Dse correction, cloud droplet concentration closure was also achieved, or nearly achieved, on three study days. Discrepancies between predicted and measured CCN, or between predicted and measured droplet concentration, were always in the direction of predicted values being larger than that measured. Although theoretical studies do specify scenarios where droplet concentration and CCN overestimation can occur, the observed disparities may also be due to multiple and poorly characterized experimental biases.},

Specifically, the globally averaged surface air temperature and amount of precipitation could increase in less than a decade by 0.8 K and 3\%, respectively, if the entire amount of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols were removed from the atmosphere. The geographic patterns of the calculated changes bear resemblance with those found in greenhouse gas and aerosol scenario experiments (annual mean temperature increase of approximately 1 K on most continents, 4 K in the Arctic). This study suggests that possible future changes as well as the general issue of the stability of atmospheric aerosol loads should be considered in strategies aiming to maintain global warming below a prescribed threshold. It also underscores the need to account for associated possible changes in precipitation in such strategies.},

	abstract = {Recent improvements to many global climate models include detailed, prognostic aerosol calculations intended to better reproduce the observed climate. However, the trace gas and aerosol fields are treated at the grid cell scale with no attempt to account for subgrid impacts on the aerosol fields. This paper begins to quantify the error introduced by the neglected subgrid variability for the shortwave direct aerosol radiative forcing for a representative climate model grid spacing of 75 km. An analysis of the value added in downscaling aerosol fields is also presented to give context to the WRF-Chem simulations used for the subgrid analysis. We found that the impact of neglected subgrid variability on the direct aerosol radiative forcing is strongest in regions of complex topography and complicated flow patterns. Evidence also suggests that scale-induced differences in emissions, particularly for emissions calculated online, such as dust, contribute strongly to the impact of neglected subgrid processes on the aerosol radiative forcing. The two of these effects together, when simulated at 75 km versus 3 km in WRF-Chem, result in an average daytime mean bias of over 30\% error in top-of-atmosphere shortwave direct aerosol radiative forcing for a large percentage of central Mexico during the Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations (MILAGRO) field campaign and an average mean bias of 10\% when averaged over the entire analysis region and 17 day period.},

To capture feedbacks from impacted natural or socio-economic systems requires interactive two-way coupling, but this is generally computationally infeasible with even moderately complex general circulation models (GCMs). Dimension reduction using emulation is one solution to this problem, demonstrated here with the GCM PLASIM-ENTS (Planet Simulator coupled with the efficient numerical terrestrial scheme). Our approach generates temporally evolving spatial patterns of climate variables, considering multiple modes of variability in order to capture non-linear feedbacks. The emulator provides a 188-member ensemble of decadally and spatially resolved ({\textasciitilde} 5° resolution) seasonal climate data in response to an arbitrary future CO2 concentration and non-CO2 radiative forcing scenario. We present the PLASIM-ENTS coupled model, the construction of its emulator from an ensemble of transient future simulations, an application of the emulator methodology to produce heating and cooling degree-day projections, the validation of the simulator (with respect to empirical data) and the validation of the emulator (with respect to high-complexity models). We also demonstrate the application to estimates of sea-level rise and associated uncertainty.},

An “aerosol‐cloud” closure study was carried out in which a detailed cloud activation parcel model, which predicts cloud drop concentration using observed aerosol concentration, size distribution, cloud updraft velocity, and thermodynamic state, is evaluated against observations. On average, measured droplet concentration in adiabatic cloud regions is within 15\% of the predictions. This agreement is corroborated by independent measurements of aerosol activation carried out by two cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) counters on the aircraft. Variations in aerosol concentration, which ranged from 300 to 3300 cm−3, drives large microphysical differences (250–2300 cm−3) observed among continental and maritime clouds in the South Florida region. This is the first known study in which a cloud parcel model is evaluated in a closure study using a constraining set of data collected from a single platform. Likewise, this is the first known study in which relationships among aerosol size distribution, CCN spectrum, and cloud droplet concentration are all found to be consistent with theory within experimental uncertainties much less than 50\%. Vertical profiles of cloud microphysical properties (effective radius, droplet concentration, dispersion) clearly demonstrate the boundary layer aerosol's effect on cloud microphysics throughout the lowest 1 km of cloud depth. Onboard measurements of aerosol hygroscopic growth and the organic to sulfate mass ratio are related to CCN properties. These chemical data are used to quantify the range of uncertainty associated with the simplified treatment of aerosol composition assumed in the closure study.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in weather and climate models is required to assess the sensitivity of their outputs to various parameterization schemes and thereby improve their consistency with observations. Herein, we present an efficient UQ and Bayesian inference for the cloud parameters of the NCAR Single Column Atmosphere Model (SCAM6) using surrogate models based on a polynomial chaos expansion. The use of a surrogate model enables to efficiently propagate uncertainties in parameters into uncertainties in model outputs. We investigated eight uncertain parameters: the auto-conversion size threshold for ice to snow (dcs), the fall speed parameter for stratiform cloud ice (ai), the fall speed parameter for stratiform snow (as), the fall speed parameter for cloud water (ac), the collection efficiency of aggregation ice (eii), the efficiency factor of the Bergeron effect (berg\_eff), the threshold maximum relative humidity for ice clouds (rhmaxi), and the threshold minimum relative humidity for ice clouds (rhmini). We built two surrogate models using two non-intrusive methods: spectral projection (SP) and basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). Our results suggest that BPDN performs better than SP as it enables to filter out internal noise during the process of fitting the surrogate model. Five out of the eight parameters (namely dcs, ai, rhmaxi, rhmini, and eii) account for most of the variance in predicted climate variables (e.g., total precipitation, cloud distribution, shortwave and longwave cloud radiative effect, ice, and liquid water path). A first-order sensitivity analysis reveals that dcs contributes {\textasciitilde}40–80\% of the total variance of the climate variables, ai around 15–30\%, and rhmaxi, rhmini, and eii around 5–15\%. The second- and higher-order effects contribute {\textasciitilde}7 and 20\%, respectively. The sensitivity of the model to these parameters was further explored using response curves. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm was also implemented for the Bayesian inference of dcs, ai, as, rhmini, and berg\_eff using cloud distribution data collected at the Southern Great Plains (USA). The inferred parameters suggest improvements in the global Climate Earth System Model (CESM2) simulations of the tropics and sub-tropics.},

This model contains the following simplications: a limited computational domain, an idealized topography, no beat transport by ocean currents, and fixed cloudiness. Despite these limitations, the results from this computation yield some indication of how the increase of CO2 concentration may affect the distribution of temperature in the atmosphere. It is shown that the CO2 increase raises the temperature of the model troposphere, whereas it lowers that of the model stratosphere. The tropospheric warming is somewhat larger than that expected from a radiative-convective equilibrium model. In particular, the increase of surface temperature in higher latitudes is magnified due to the recession of the snow boundary and the thermal stability of the lower troposphere which limits convective beating to the lowest layer. It is also shown that the doubling of carbon dioxide significantly increases the intensity of the hydrologic cycle of the model.},

	abstract = {Aerosol processes and, in particular, aerosol‐cloud interactions cut across the traditional physical‐Earth system boundary of coupled Earth system models and remain one of the key uncertainties in estimating anthropogenic radiative forcing of climate. Here we calculate the historical aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) in the HadGEM3‐GA7 climate model in order to assess the suitability of this model for inclusion in the UK Earth system model, UKESM1. The aerosol ERF, calculated for the year 2000 relative to 1850, is large and negative in the standard GA7 model leading to an unrealistic negative total anthropogenic forcing over the twentieth century. We show how underlying assumptions and missing processes in both the physical model and aerosol parameterizations lead to this large aerosol ERF. A number of model improvements are investigated to assess their impact on the aerosol ERF. These include an improved representation of cloud droplet spectral dispersion, updates to the aerosol activation scheme, and black carbon optical properties. One of the largest contributors to the aerosol forcing uncertainty is insufficient knowledge of the preindustrial aerosol climate. We evaluate the contribution of uncertainties in the natural marine emissions of dimethyl sulfide and organic aerosol to the ERF. The combination of model improvements derived from these studies weakens the aerosol ERF by up to 50\% of the original value and leads to a total anthropogenic historical forcing more in line with assessed values. The HadGEM3‐GA7 climate model has a large, negative aerosol ERF resulting in an unrealistic negative total anthropogenic forcing of climate The aerosol ERF is shown to be highly sensitive to the underlying physical and aerosol model processes and parameterizations Through a combination of scientific model improvements the aerosol ERF is reduced by up to 50\% from –2.75 to –1.45 W/m2},

A comprehensive analysis of satellite observations shows that thermodynamics and precipitation govern cloud responses to aerosols. Changes in aerosol concentrations affect cloud albedo and Earth’s radiative balance1. Aerosol radiative forcing from pre-industrial time to the present due to the effect of atmospheric aerosol levels on the micro- and macrophysics of clouds bears the largest uncertainty among external influences on climate change1. Of all cloud forms, low-level marine clouds exert the largest impact on the planet’s albedo2. For example, a 6\% increase in the albedo of global marine stratiform clouds could offset the warming that would result from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations3. Marine warm cloud properties are thought to depend on aerosol levels and large-scale dynamic or thermodynamic states4,5,6. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of multiple measurements from the A-Train constellation of Earth-observing satellites, to quantify the radiative forcing exerted by aerosols interacting with marine clouds. Specifically, we analyse observations of co-located aerosols and clouds over the world’s oceans for the period August 2006–April 2011, comprising over 7.3 million CloudSat single-layer marine warm cloud pixels. We find that thermodynamic conditions—that is, tropospheric stability and humidity in the free troposphere—and the state of precipitation act together to govern the cloud liquid water responses to the presence of aerosols and the strength of aerosol–cloud radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Using the method of offline radiative transfer modeling within the partial radiative perturbation (PRP) approach, the effective radiative forcing by aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) in the ECHAM–HAMMOZ aerosol climate model is decomposed into a radiative forcing by anthropogenic cloud droplet number change and adjustments of the liquid water path and cloud fraction. The simulated radiative forcing by anthropogenic cloud droplet number change and liquid water path adjustment are of approximately equal magnitude at −0.52 and −0.53 W m−2, respectively, while the cloud-fraction adjustment is somewhat weaker at −0.31 W m−2 (constituting 38 \%, 39 \%, and 23 \% of the total ERFaci, respectively); geographically, all three ERFaci components in the simulation peak over China, the subtropical eastern ocean boundaries, the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Europe, and eastern North America (in order of prominence). Spatial correlations indicate that the temporal-mean liquid water path adjustment is proportional to the temporal-mean radiative forcing, while the relationship between cloud-fraction adjustment and radiative forcing is less direct. While the estimate of warm-cloud ERFaci is relatively insensitive to the treatment of ice and mixed-phase cloud overlying warm cloud, there are indications that more restrictive treatments of ice in the column result in a low bias in the estimated magnitude of the liquid water path adjustment and a high bias in the estimated magnitude of the droplet number forcing. Since the present work is the first PRP decomposition of the aerosol effective radiative forcing into radiative forcing and rapid cloud adjustments, idealized experiments are conducted to provide evidence that the PRP results are accurate. The experiments show that using low-frequency (daily or monthly) time-averaged model output of the cloud property fields underestimates the ERF, but 3-hourly mean output is sufficiently frequent.},

This was possible by examining continuous day and night geostationary satellite data that allowed for an uninterrupted documentation of the full life cycle of ship tracks. After nearly one day the ship tracks lost their linear appearance and expanded to cover large areas. These areas, when viewed out of sequence and context, would not be attributable to aerosol perturbations. A rejuvenation of previously dissipated ship tracks in the form of extensive closed cells was also observed. It is suggested that ship emissions may undergo photochemical reactions which nucleate new aerosols that, along with remaining ultrafine particles, grow to CCN that are activated hours later and close the open cells. The added radiative forcing from the closed cells that can be related to the ship tracks, which is mainly coming from the cloud cover effect, may exceed −100 Wm−2, depending on the season and latitude. This implies that anthropogenic aerosols that can be transported from continents through the boundary layer, or travel in the free troposphere and mix with the boundary layer from above, may explain the formation of large closed cells areas that are presently not recognized as originated by aerosol perturbations. The observations reported here pose a demanding test of the ability of cloud resolving models to replicate cloud-aerosol interactions.},

These are (i) a tight convective coupling of the surface to the troposphere, (ii) an assumption of fixed relative humidity rather than fixed absolute humidity, and (iii) a sufficiently realistic representation of greenhouse gas radiative transfer. Previous studies had separately identified these key ingredients, but none had properly combined them. We then discuss each of these ingredients in turn, highlighting how subsequent research in the intervening decades has only cemented their importance for understanding global climate change.

Ship tracks are changes in cloud reflectance, visible in satellite data, and result from the emission of aerosols and their precursors by ships into the clean marine boundary layer. An algorithm is presented that extracts scenes dominated by low clouds over the oceans that are susceptible to be affected by ship emissions. These selected cloud scenes are used to examine ship tracks on a global scale via visual analysis. The results show a high temporal variability of ship track occurrence with peak values in July. They also show a high spatial variability with peak values in the North Pacific Ocean and on the west coast of southern Africa, correlated with high ship traffic and frequent low cloud occurrence in regions of cold upwelling ocean currents. The analysis of backscattered radiation at top of the atmosphere (TOA) compared to the surrounding area reveals enhanced backscattering with values between 0 and 100 Wm−2. For particular regions on the west coast of North America, the annual mean RF due to ship tracks estimated by the changes in backscattered radiation at TOA can be up to −50 mWm−2. The global annual mean RF due to ship tracks is small (−0.4 to −0.6 mWm−2) and negligible compared to previous global model estimates on the total indirect aerosol effect and RF contributions of other ship emissions.},

	abstract = {Aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty affects estimates of climate sensitivity and limits model skill in terms of making climate projections. Efforts to improve the representations of physical processes in climate models, including extensive comparisons with observations, have not significantly constrained the range of possible aerosol forcing values. A far stronger constraint, in particular for the lower (most-negative) bound, can be achieved using global mean energy balance arguments based on observed changes in historical temperature. Here, we show that structural deficiencies in a climate model, revealed as inconsistencies among observationally constrained cloud properties in the model, limit the effectiveness of observational constraint of the uncertain physical processes. We sample the uncertainty in 37 model parameters related to aerosols, clouds, and radiation in a perturbed parameter ensemble of the UK Earth System Model and evaluate 1 million model variants (different parameter settings from Gaussian process emulators) against satellite-derived observations over several cloudy regions. Our analysis of a very large set of model variants exposes model internal inconsistencies that would not be apparent in a small set of model simulations, of an order that may be evaluated during model-tuning efforts. Incorporating observations associated with these inconsistencies weakens any forcing constraint because they require a wider range of parameter values to accommodate conflicting information. We show that, by neglecting variables associated with these inconsistencies, it is possible to reduce the parametric uncertainty in global mean aerosol forcing by more than 50 \%, constraining it to a range (around -1.3 to -0.1 Wm-2) in close agreement with energy balance constraints. Our estimated aerosol forcing range is the maximum feasible constraint using our structurally imperfect model and the chosen observations. Structural model developments targeted at the identified inconsistencies would enable a larger set of observations to be used for constraint, which would then very likely narrow the uncertainty further and possibly alter the central estimate. Such an approach provides a rigorous pathway to improved model realism and reduced uncertainty that has so far not been achieved through the normal model development approach.},

This hybrid approach allows PINO to overcome the limitations of purely data-driven and physics-based methods. For instance, data-driven methods fail to learn when data is of limited quantity and/or quality, and physics-based approaches fail to optimize on challenging PDE constraints. By combining both data and PDE constraints, PINO overcomes all these challenges. Additionally, a unique property that PINO enjoys over other hybrid learning methods is its ability to incorporate data and PDE constraints at different resolutions. This allows us to combine coarse-resolution data, which is inexpensive to obtain from numerical solvers, with higher resolution PDE constraints, and the resulting PINO has no degradation in accuracy even on high-resolution test instances. This discretization-invariance property in PINO is due to neural-operator framework which learns mappings between function spaces and allows evaluation at different resolutions without the need for re-training. Moreover, PINO succeeds in the purely physics setting, where no data is available, while other approaches such as the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) fail due to optimization challenges, e.g. in multi-scale dynamic systems such as Kolmogorov flows. This is because PINO learns the solution operator by optimizing PDE constraints on multiple instances while PINN optimizes PDE constraints of a single PDE instance. Further, in PINO, we incorporate the Fourier neural operator (FNO) architecture which achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over numerical solvers and also allows us to compute explicit gradients on function spaces efficiently.},

The success of the CGAN in solving this problem suggests that generative adversarial networks are applicable to a wide range of problems in atmospheric science, a field characterized by complex spatial structures and observational uncertainties. We trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate cloud vertical structures The network generates plausible CloudSat scenes, given MODIS data as an input This demonstrates the potential usefulness of GANs in atmospheric science},

	abstract = {The influence of clouds on the large-scale atmospheric circulation is examined in numerical simulations from an atmospheric general circulation model run with and without atmospheric cloud radiative effects (ACRE). In the extratropics of both hemispheres, the primary impacts of ACRE on the circulation include 1) increases in the meridional temperature gradient and decreases in static stability in the midlatitude upper troposphere, 2) strengthening of the midlatitude jet, 3) increases in extratropical eddy kinetic energy by up to 30\%, and 4) increases in precipitation at middle latitudes but decreases at subtropical latitudes. In the tropics, the primary impacts of ACRE include 1) eastward wind anomalies in the tropical upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS) and 2) reductions in tropical precipitation. The impacts of ACRE on the atmospheric circulation are interpreted in the context of a series of dynamical and physical processes. The changes in the extratropical circulation and precipitation are consistent with the influence of ACRE on the baroclinicity and eddy fluxes of momentum in the extratropical upper troposphere, the changes in the zonal wind in the UTLS with the influence of ACRE on the amplitude of the equatorial planetary waves, and the changes in the tropical precipitation with the energetic constraints on the tropical troposphere. The results make clear that ACRE have a pronounced influence on the atmospheric circulation not only at tropical latitudes, but at extratropical latitudes as well. They highlight the critical importance of correctly simulating ACRE in global climate models.},

This is done with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6), the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). We apply the PPE method to CESM2–CAM6 to understand climate sensitivity to atmospheric physics parameters. The initial simulations vary 45 parameters in the microphysics, convection, turbulence and aerosol schemes with 263 ensemble members. These atmospheric parameters are typically the most uncertain in many climate models. Control simulations and targeted simulations to understand climate forcing due to aerosols and fast climate feedbacks are analyzed. The use of various emulators is explored in the multi-dimensional space mapping input parameters to output metrics. Parameter impacts on various model outputs, such as radiation, cloud and aerosol properties, are evaluated. Machine learning is also used to probe optimal parameter values against observations. Our findings show that PPE is a valuable tool for climate uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, by varying many parameters simultaneously, we find that many different combinations of parameter values can produce results consistent with observations, and thus careful analysis of tuning is important. The CESM2–CAM6 PPE is publicly available and extensible to other configurations to address questions of other model processes in the atmosphere and other model components (e.g., coupling to the land surface).},

Subdivisions with fat cells satisfy a property called the packing constraint, which bounds the number of disjoint cells of a given size that can overlap a ball of a given radius.

	abstract = {Modern climate projections often suffer from inadequate spatial and temporal resolution due to computational limitations, resulting in inaccurate representations of sub-resolution processes. A promising technique to address this is the Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF), which embeds a small-domain, kilometer-resolution cloud-resolving model within each atmospheric column of a host climate model to replace traditional convection and cloud parameterizations. Machine learning (ML) offers a unique opportunity to make MMF more accessible by emulating the embedded cloud-resolving model and thereby reducing its substantial computational cost. Although many studies have demonstrated proof-of-concept success of emulating the MMF model with stable hybrid simulations, it remains a challenge to achieve operational-level success with real geography and comprehensive variable emulation, such as explicit cloud condensate coupling. In this study, we present a stable hybrid model capable of integrating for at least 5 years with near operational-level complexity, including real geography, seasonality, explicit predictions of cloud condensate and wind tendencies, and land coupling. Our model demonstrates skillful online performance such as 5-year zonal mean biases when comparing to previous MMF emulation studies. Key factors contributing to this online performance include using an expressive U-Net architecture, leveraging input features that includes large-scale forcings and convection memory, and incorporating microphysical constraints. With microphysical constraints mitigating unrealistic cloud formation, our work is the first work that demonstrates realistic multi-year cloud condensate climatology under the multi-scale modeling framework. Our work showcases the potential of ML parameterization for operational-level climate simulations.},

	abstract = {Retrospectively comparing future model projections to observations provides a robust and independent test of model skill. Here we analyze the performance of climate models published between 1970 and 2007 in projecting future global mean surface temperature (GMST) changes. Models are compared to observations based on both the change in GMST over time and the change in GMST over the change in external forcing. The latter approach accounts for mismatches in model forcings, a potential source of error in model projections independent of the accuracy of model physics. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were skillful in predicting subsequent GMST changes, with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations, particularly when mismatches between model‐projected and observationally estimated forcings were taken into account. Climate models provide an important way to understand future changes in the Earth's climate. In this paper we undertake a thorough evaluation of the performance of various climate models published between the early 1970s and the late 2000s. Specifically, we look at how well models project global warming in the years after they were published by comparing them to observed temperature changes. Model projections rely on two things to accurately match observations: accurate modeling of climate physics and accurate assumptions around future emissions of CO2 and other factors affecting the climate. The best physics‐based model will still be inaccurate if it is driven by future changes in emissions that differ from reality. To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2 (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts and increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming. Evaluation of uninitialized multidecadal climate model future projection performance provides a concrete test of model skill The quasi‐linear relationship between model/observed forcings and temperature change is used to control for errors in projected forcing Model simulations published between 1970 and 2007 were skillful in projecting future global mean surface warming},

Our results highlight challenges and opportunities for data-driven climate modelling, especially concerning the incorporation of even larger model datasets in the future.

	abstract = {Periods of dimming and brightening have been recorded in observational datasets of surface solar radiation (SSR) between the mid‐20th century and present day. Atmospheric components affect SSR, including aerosols and clouds, though studies disagree somewhat about the relative effect of each component in different regions. Current Earth system models (ESMs) are unable to simulate observed trends in SSR. This study includes an investigation into observed SSR variations between 1961 and 2014 and an evaluation of the effects of cloud cover variations and impacts of aerosol extinction, using timeseries of SSR and cloud cover from in‐situ measurements. Historical simulations by 42 ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) have also been studied and compared to observations. The observational study indicates that cloud cover has had a dampening effect on the variations of SSR and that emissions of aerosol and aerosol precursors are the main cause of the general trends in observed SSR in four regions—China, Japan, Europe, and the United States—during 1961–2014. The study of simulated SSR in CMIP6 yields the conclusion that current ESMs remain unable to simulate the magnitude of observed dimming and brightening in China, Japan, and the United States, but that the European SSR trends between 1961 and 2014 are fairly well reproduced in the ESMs. A rough quantification of the regional surface radiation extinction efficiency of aerosol and precursor emissions in the simulations is found to agree with observed values in Europe, but not in the other three regions. Measurements of incoming sunlight at the Earth's surface between the 1960s and the 1980s show a substantial downward trend globally, and between the 1980s and the 2000s an upward trend has followed, albeit weaker. These two trends are often called dimming and brightening, respectively. The reasons for dimming and brightening are not clear, although evidence supports the role of atmospheric components, prominently aerosol emissions and clouds; changes in aerosol emissions and clouds can cause changes in incoming sunlight at the surface because of their ability to absorb or reflect sunlight on its way through the atmosphere. In this study, measurements of incoming sunlight at the surface are investigated and compared with simulations from state‐of‐the‐art Earth system models (ESMs). The study reinforce evidence that aerosol emission changes have been causal to observed regional dimming and brightening, and suggests that cloud cover changes have not caused the trends. The study also finds that ESMs are unable to compute dimming and brightening trends in several regions, which may suggest that the models are not accurately reproducing the atmospheric processes that cause the trends. This study supports evidence that dimming and brightening trends between 1961 and 2014 in China, Japan, Europe and the United States were caused by variations in aerosol‐ and aerosol precursor emissions, and not by cloud cover changes Results confirm and reinforce previous indications that Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 simulations are able to reproduce surface solar radiation trends observed in Europe, but not in China, Japan, and the United States This study supports evidence that dimming and brightening trends between 1961 and 2014 in China, Japan, Europe and the United States were caused by variations in aerosol‐ and aerosol precursor emissions, and not by cloud cover changes Results confirm and reinforce previous indications that Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 simulations are able to reproduce surface solar radiation trends observed in Europe, but not in China, Japan, and the United States},

The new hybrid approach is designed for a two-fold scope: (i) emulating hidden, possibly chaotic, dynamics and (ii) predicting their future states. The method consists in applying iteratively a data assimilation step, here an ensemble Kalman filter, and a neural network. Data assimilation is used to optimally combine a surrogate model with sparse noisy data. The output analysis is spatially complete and is used as a training set by the neural network to update the surrogate model. The two steps are then repeated iteratively. Numerical experiments have been carried out using the chaotic 40-variables Lorenz 96 model, proving both convergence and statistical skill of the proposed hybrid approach. The surrogate model shows short-term forecast skill up to two Lyapunov times, the retrieval of positive Lyapunov exponents as well as the more energetic frequencies of the power density spectrum. The sensitivity of the method to critical setup parameters is also presented: the forecast skill decreases smoothly with increased observational noise but drops abruptly if less than half of the model domain is observed. The successful synergy between data assimilation and machine learning, proven here with a low-dimensional system, encourages further investigation of such hybrids with more sophisticated dynamics.},

These took place from 17 August to 5 September 2017, during the African biomass burning (BB) season. The primary motivation was to give confidence in the use of data from multiple platforms with which to evaluate numerical climate models. The three platforms were involved in the CLouds–Aerosol–Radiation Interaction and Forcing for Year 2017 (CLARIFY-2017), ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES), and Layered Atlantic Smoke and Interactions with Clouds (LASIC) field experiments. Comparisons from flight segments on 6 d where the BAe-146 flew alongside the ARM facility on Ascension Island are presented, along with comparisons from the wing-tip-to-wing-tip flight of the P3 and BAe-146 on 18 August 2017. The intercomparison flight sampled a relatively clean atmosphere overlying a moderately polluted boundary layer, while the six fly-bys of the ARM site sampled both clean and polluted conditions 2–4 km upwind. We compare and validate characterisations of aerosol physical, chemical and optical properties as well as atmospheric radiation and cloud microphysics between platforms. We assess the performance of measurement instrumentation in the field, under conditions where sampling conditions are not as tightly controlled as in laboratory measurements where calibrations are performed. Solar radiation measurements compared well enough to permit radiative closure studies. Optical absorption coefficient measurements from all three platforms were within uncertainty limits, although absolute magnitudes were too low ({\textless}10 Mm-1) to fully support a comparison of the absorption Ångström exponents. Aerosol optical absorption measurements from airborne platforms were more comparable than aircraft-to-ground observations. Scattering coefficient observations compared adequately between airborne platforms, but agreement with ground-based measurements was worse, potentially caused by small differences in sampling conditions or actual aerosol population differences over land. Chemical composition measurements followed a similar pattern, with better comparisons between the airborne platforms. Thermodynamics, aerosol and cloud microphysical properties generally agreed given uncertainties.},

Observation-based studies have shown that the aerosol cloud lifetime effect or the increase of cloud liquid water path (LWP) with increased aerosol loading may have been overestimated in climate models. Here, we simulate shallow warm clouds on 27 May 2011 at the southern Great Plains (SGP) measurement site established by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program using a single-column version of a global climate model (Community Atmosphere Model or CAM) and a cloud resolving model (CRM). The LWP simulated by CAM increases substantially with aerosol loading while that in the CRM does not. The increase of LWP in CAM is caused by a large decrease of the autoconversion rate when cloud droplet number increases. In the CRM, the autoconversion rate is also reduced, but this is offset or even outweighed by the increased evaporation of cloud droplets near the cloud top, resulting in an overall decrease in LWP. Our results suggest that climate models need to include the dependence of cloud top growth and the evaporation/condensation process on cloud droplet number concentrations.},

	abstract = {A simple plume implementation of the second version (v2) of the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, MACv2-SP, is described. MACv2-SP provides a prescription of anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated Twomey effect. It was created to provide a harmonized description of post-1850 anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing for climate modeling studies. MACv2-SP has been designed to be easy to implement, change and use, and thereby enable studies exploring the climatic effects of different patterns of aerosol radiative forcing, including a Twomey effect. MACv2-SP is formulated in terms of nine spatial plumes associated with different major anthropogenic source regions. The shape of the plumes is fit to the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, version 2, whose present-day (2005) distribution is anchored by surface-based observations. Two types of plumes are considered: one predominantly associated with biomass burning, the other with industrial emissions. These differ in the prescription of their annual cycle and in their optical properties, thereby implicitly accounting for different contributions of absorbing aerosol to the different plumes. A Twomey effect for each plume is prescribed as a change in the host model's background cloud-droplet population density using relationships derived from satellite data. Year-to-year variations in the amplitude of the plumes over the historical period (1850–2016) are derived by scaling the plumes with associated national emission sources of SO2 and NH3. Experiments using MACv2-SP are performed with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. The globally and annually averaged instantaneous and effective aerosol radiative forcings are estimated to be −0.6 and −0.5 W m−2, respectively. Forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions (the Twomey effect) offsets the reduction of clear-sky forcing by clouds, so that the net effect of clouds on the aerosol forcing is small; hence, the clear-sky forcing, which is more readily measurable, provides a good estimate of the total aerosol forcing.},

	abstract = {The second version of the coupled Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2) is presented and evaluated. NorESM2 is based on the second version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) and shares with CESM2 the computer code infrastructure and many Earth system model components. However, NorESM2 employs entirely different ocean and ocean biogeochemistry models. The atmosphere component of NorESM2 (CAM-Nor) includes a different module for aerosol physics and chemistry, including interactions with cloud and radiation; additionally, CAM-Nor includes improvements in the formulation of local dry and moist energy conservation, in local and global angular momentum conservation, and in the computations for deep convection and air–sea fluxes. The surface components of NorESM2 have minor changes in the albedo calculations and to land and sea-ice models. We present results from simulations with NorESM2 that were carried out for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Two versions of the model are used: one with lower (∼ 2∘) atmosphere–land resolution and one with medium (∼ 1∘) atmosphere–land resolution. The stability of the pre-industrial climate and the sensitivity of the model to abrupt and gradual quadrupling of CO2 are assessed, along with the ability of the model to simulate the historical climate under the CMIP6 forcings. Compared to observations and reanalyses, NorESM2 represents an improvement over previous versions of NorESM in most aspects. NorESM2 appears less sensitive to greenhouse gas forcing than its predecessors, with an estimated equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.5 K in both resolutions on a 150-year time frame; however, this estimate increases with the time window and the climate sensitivity at equilibration is much higher. We also consider the model response to future scenarios as defined by selected Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) from the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project defined under CMIP6. Under the four scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5), the warming in the period 2090–2099 compared to 1850–1879 reaches 1.3, 2.2, 3.0, and 3.9 K in NorESM2-LM, and 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, and 3.9 K in NorESM-MM, robustly similar in both resolutions. NorESM2-LM shows a rather satisfactory evolution of recent sea-ice area. In NorESM2-LM, an ice-free Arctic Ocean is only avoided in the SSP1-2.6 scenario.},

Aerosol Sci. 30, 3–16] but using a more detailed coagulation coefficient instead of the simple approach—the harmonic mean—Park et al. [(1999) J. Aerosol Sci. 30, 3–16] is derived. Comparisons are made with the analytical solution given in Park et al. [(1999) J. Aerosol Sci. 30, 3–16], with a method of moments model, with a log-normal reference model as well as with a sectional model (Landgrebe and Pratsinis, (1990) J. Colloid Interface Sci. 139, 63–86).In order to make a fair comparison between the models, all of them should use the same coagulation coefficients except Park et al. [(1999) J. Aerosol Sci. 30, 3–16] which is already fixed to the harmonic mean method. The most frequently used coagulation coefficients to describe the process of Brownian coagulation in the entire size regime (Fuchs, Dahneke, harmonic mean) were compared and a universal enhancement function to the near-continuum coagulation kernel is given. Furthermore, Fuchs’ coagulation kernel is reviewed and modified for the use with different sized particles. It was shown that Dahneke’s coagulation kernel is very close to those of Fuchs and Wright with a relative error of less than 1\%. Based on this finding, Dahneke’s coagulation kernel is used in the models developed as well as during the comparison.In order to develop fast and easy-to-use coagulation models we used the moment method assuming a log-normal size distribution function [Lee et al., (1997), J. Colloid Interface Sci. 188, 486–492]. In the first step the integrals over the particle size distribution are solved analytically and DGEAR (IMSL, 1980) is used to solve for the time dependence. In the second step we solved also the time dependence of the parameters of the size distribution analytically. The models developed are compared over a wide parameter range with a reference model based on the moment method of log-normal size distribution functions as well as a sectional reference model. For a worst case, the moment method shows a relative error of less than 4\% for the number concentration; the mean geometric standard deviation and the volume square concentration and for the geometric standard deviation the relative error is less than 8\% in the self-preserving state. The analytical solution developed shows a maximum relative error of less than 10\% if the dimensionless time is limited to KcoN0t=1.},

Most notably, we introduce a new indicator, called "integration", which characterizes the number of interacting components of the climate system being explicitly described in a model. The location of several model types, from conceptual to comprehensive, is presented in a new spectrum of climate system models. In particular, the location of the Earth system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) in this spectrum is discussed in some detail and examples are given, which indicate that there is currently a broad range of EMICs in use. In some EMICs, the number of processes and/or the detail of description is reduced for the sake of simulating the feedbacks between as many components of the climate system as feasible. Others, with a lesser degree of interaction, or "integration", are used for long-term ensemble simulations to study specific aspects of climate variability. EMICs appear to be closer to comprehensive coupled models of atmospheric and oceanic circulation (CGCMs) than to "conceptual" or "box" models. We advocate that EMICs be considered as complementary to CGCMs and conceptual models, because we believe that there is an advantage of having a spectrum of climate system models which are designed to tackle specific aspects of climate and which together provide the proper tool for climate system modeling.},

	abstract = {A simple heuristic model is described to assess the potential for increasing solar reflection by augmenting the aerosol population below marine low clouds, which nominally leads to increased cloud droplet concentration and albedo. The model estimates the collective impact of many point-source particle sprayers, each of which generates a plume of injected particles that affects clouds over a limited area. A widely-used aerosol activation scheme is used to derive cloud droplet concentration as a function of the sub-cloud aerosol size distribution and updraft speed, and a modified version of Twomey's formulation is used to estimate radiative forcing. Plume overlap is accounted for using a Poisson distribution assuming idealized elongated cuboid plumes that have a length driven by aerosol lifetime and wind speed, a width consistent with satellite observations of ship track broadening, and a depth equal to an assumed boundary layer depth. The model is found to perform favorably against estimates of brightening from large eddy simulation studies that explicitly model cloud responses to aerosol injections over a range of conditions. Although the heuristic model does not account for cloud condensate or coverage adjustments to aerosol, in most realistic ambient remote marine conditions these tend to augment the Twomey effect in the large eddy simulations, with the resulting being a modest underprediction of brightening in the heuristic model. The heuristic model is used to evaluate the potential for global radiative forcing from marine cloud brightening as a function of the quantity, size, and lifetime of salt particles injected per sprayer and the number of sprayers deployed. Radiative forcing is sensitive to both the background aerosol size distribution in the marine boundary layer into which particles are injected, and the assumed updraft speed. Given representative values from the literature, radiative forcing sufficient to offset a doubling of carbon dioxide ΔF2xCO2 is possible but would require spraying over 50\% or more of the ocean area. This is likely to require at least 104 sprayers to avoid major losses of particles due to near-sprayer coagulation. The optimal dry diameter of injected particles, for a given salt mass injection rate, is 30–60 nm. A major consequence is that the total salt emission rate (50–70 Tg/yr) required to offset F2xCO2 is a factor of five lower than the emissions rates required to generate significant forcing in previous studies with climate models, which have mostly assumed dry diameters for injected particles in excess of 200 nm. With the lower required emissions, the salt mass loading in the marine boundary layer for F2xCO2 is dominated by natural salt aerosol, with injected particles only contributing {\textasciitilde} 10\%. When using particle sizes optimized for cloud brightening, the aerosol direct radiative forcing is shown to make a minimal contribution to the overall radiative forcing.},

In this study, using 4 years (2007–2008 and 2010–2011) of CALIOP version 3 L2 aerosol data, the occurrence frequency of daytime CALIOP profiles containing all RFVs (all-RFV profiles) is studied. In the CALIOP data products, the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of any all-RFV profile is reported as being zero, which may introduce a bias in CALIOP-based AOT climatologies. For this study, we derive revised estimates of AOT for all-RFV profiles using collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target (DT) and, where available, AErosol RObotic NEtwork (AERONET) data. Globally, all-RFV profiles comprise roughly 71 \% of all daytime CALIOP L2 aerosol profiles (i.e., including completely attenuated profiles), accounting for nearly half (45 \%) of all daytime cloud-free L2 aerosol profiles. The mean collocated MODIS DT (AERONET) 550 nm AOT is found to be near 0.06 (0.08) for CALIOP all-RFV profiles. We further estimate a global mean aerosol extinction profile, a so-called noise floor, for CALIOP all-RFV profiles. The global mean CALIOP AOT is then recomputed by replacing RFV values with the derived noise-floor values for both all-RFV and non-all-RFV profiles. This process yields an improvement in the agreement of CALIOP and MODIS over-ocean AOT.},

However, as their dynamical scales are too small to be resolvable in global climate models, predictions of their response to greenhouse warming have remained uncertain. Here we report how stratocumulus decks respond to greenhouse warming in large-eddy simulations that explicitly resolve cloud dynamics in a representative subtropical region. In the simulations, stratocumulus decks become unstable and break up into scattered clouds when CO2 levels rise above 1,200 ppm. In addition to the warming from rising CO2 levels, this instability triggers a surface warming of about 8 K globally and 10 K in the subtropics. Once the stratocumulus decks have broken up, they only re-form once CO2 concentrations drop substantially below the level at which the instability first occurred. Climate transitions that arise from this instability may have contributed importantly to hothouse climates and abrupt climate changes in the geological past. Such transitions to a much warmer climate may also occur in the future if CO2 levels continue to rise. Stratocumulus cloud decks—which cool the Earth’s surface by shading it from sunlight, and are prevalent in the subtropics—break up into scattered clouds when CO2 levels rise above 1,200 ppm in large-eddy simulations that explicitly resolve cloud dynamics.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The impact of aerosols on cloud properties is one of the largest uncertainties in the anthropogenic radiative forcing of the climate. Significant progress has been made in constraining this forcing using observations, but uncertainty remains, particularly in the magnitude of cloud rapid adjustments to aerosol perturbations. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is the leading control on liquid-cloud albedo, making it important to observationally constrain the aerosol impact on LWP. Previous modelling and observational studies have shown that multiple processes play a role in determining the LWP response to aerosol perturbations, but that the aerosol effect can be difficult to isolate. Following previous studies using mediating variables, this work investigates use of the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) and LWP for constraining the role of aerosols. Using joint-probability histograms to account for the non-linear relationship, this work finds a relationship that is broadly consistent with previous studies. There is significant geographical variation in the relationship, partly due to role of meteorological factors (particularly relative humidity). The Nd–LWP relationship is negative in the majority of regions, suggesting that aerosol-induced LWP reductions could offset a significant fraction of the instantaneous radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions (RFaci). However, variations in the Nd–LWP relationship in response to volcanic and shipping aerosol perturbations indicate that the Nd–LWP relationship overestimates the causal Nd impact on LWP due to the role of confounding factors. The weaker LWP reduction implied by these “natural experiments” means that this work provides an upper bound to the radiative forcing from aerosol-induced changes in the LWP.},

This uncertainty is primarily parametric (what numbers do we plug into our equations?), structural (what equations do we use in the first place?), and due to internal variability (natural variability intrinsic to the climate system). The former and latter are straightforward to characterise in principle, though may be computationally intensive for complex climate models. The second is more challenging to characterise and is therefore often ignored. We developed a Bayesian approach to quantify structural uncertainty in climate projections, using the idealised energy-balance model representations of climate physics that underpin many economists’ integrated assessment models (IAMs) (and therefore their policy recommendations). We define a model selection parameter, which switches on one of a suite of proposed climate nonlinearities and multidecadal climate feedbacks. We find that a model with a temperature-dependent climate feedback is most consistent with global mean surface temperature observations, but that the sign of the temperature-dependence is opposite of what Earth system models suggest. This difference of sign is likely due to the assumption tha the recent pattern effect can be represented as a temperature dependence. Moreover, models other than the most likely one contain a majority of the posterior probability, indicating that structural uncertainty is important for climate projections. Indeed, in projections using shared socioeconomic pathways similar to current emissions reductions targets, structural uncertainty dwarfs parametric uncertainty in temperature. Consequently, structural uncertainty dominates overall non-socioeconomic uncertainty in economic projections of climate change damages, as estimated from a simple temperature-to-damages calculation. These results indicate that considering structural uncertainty is crucial for IAMs in particular, and for climate projections in general.},

	abstract = {The Hamburg Aerosol Module version 2.3 (HAM2.3) from the ECHAM6.3‐HAM2.3 global atmosphere‐aerosol model is coupled to the recently developed icosahedral nonhydrostatic ICON‐A (icon‐aes‐1.3.00) global atmosphere model to yield the new ICON‐A‐HAM2.3 atmosphere‐aerosol model. The ICON‐A and ECHAM6.3 host models use different dynamical cores, parameterizations of vertical mixing due to sub‐grid scale turbulence, and parameter settings for radiation balance tuning. Here, we study the role of the different host models for simulated aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and evaluate impacts of using HAM2.3 and the ECHAM6‐HAM2.3 two‐moment cloud microphysics scheme on several meteorological variables. Sensitivity runs show that a positive AOT bias over the subtropical oceans is remedied in ICON‐A‐HAM2.3 because of a different default setting of a parameter in the moist convection parameterization of the host models. The global mean AOT is biased low compared to MODIS satellite instrument retrievals in ICON‐A‐HAM2.3 and ECHAM6.3‐HAM2.3, but the bias is larger in ICON‐A‐HAM2.3 because negative AOT biases over the Amazon, the African rain forest, and the northern Indian Ocean are no longer compensated by high biases over the sub‐tropical oceans. ICON‐A‐HAM2.3 shows a moderate improvement with respect to AOT observations at AERONET sites. A multivariable bias score combining biases of several meteorological variables into a single number is larger in ICON‐A‐HAM2.3 compared to standard ICON‐A and standard ECHAM6.3. In the tropics, this multivariable bias is of similar magnitude in ICON‐A‐HAM2.3 and in ECHAM6.3‐HAM2.3. In the extra‐tropics, a smaller multivariable bias is found for ICON‐A‐HAM2.3 than for ECHAM6.3‐HAM2.3. Aerosols are tiny particles in the air which are either emitted into the atmosphere directly or formed from precursor gases such as sulfur dioxide. Aerosols reflect and absorb solar radiation and affect the radiative properties of clouds. In order to estimate how changing emissions of aerosol precursor gases and aerosols affect the radiation budget of the atmosphere, aerosol models are coupled to global atmosphere models. Here, an aerosol model that has already been part of a well‐established coupled model is coupled to a recently developed atmosphere model. The reasons for differences between the original and the new model are investigated and simulated aerosol optical thickness is evaluated against observations. The aerosol optical thickness over subtropical oceans is lower in the new model, which is in better agreement with estimates from satellite observations. This better agreement is traced back to a parameter setting in the cloud description part in the new model. However, because cancellation of positive and negative biases is reduced in the new model, the global mean aerosol optical thickness is biased lower the new model. A bias score based on several meteorological variables is lower in the new model because of lower biases in the extra‐tropics.

In particular the OPC is characterised for (1) leakage, (2) flow and calibration stability over the expected IAGOS pressure range of 170 hPa to 1013 hPa, (3) OPC accuracy test by comparing extinction measurements with calculated values from Mie theory using the OPC size distribution and (4) the inter-instrumental precision. The CPC is characterised in the same pressure range for (1) the lower cut-off diameter, (2) the instrument accuracy by comparing with a reference instrument (Faraday Cup Electrometer, FCE) and (3) the instrument precision.

We describe a mathematical and computational framework for estimating the parameters of a simplified model from a large eddy simulation (LES). In our method, we extract cycles of cloud growth and decay from the LES and then search for parameters of the simplified model that lead to similar cycles. We implement our method via Markov chain Monte Carlo. Required error models are constructed based on variations of the LES cloud cycles. This computational framework allows us to test the robustness of our overall approach and various assumptions, which is essential for the simplified model to be useful. Our main conclusion is that it is indeed possible to calibrate a predator–prey model so that it becomes a reliable, robust, but simplified representation of selected aspects of a LES. In the future, such models may then be used as a quantitative tool for investigating important questions in cloud microphysics.},

	abstract = {Earth’s climate sensitivity to radiative forcing induced by a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 is determined by feedback mechanisms, including changes in atmospheric water vapor, clouds and surface albedo, that act to either amplify or dampen the response. The climate system is frequently interpreted in terms of a simple energy balance model, in which it is assumed that individual feedback mechanisms are additive and act independently. Here we test these assumptions by systematically controlling, or locking, the radiative feedbacks in a state-of-the-art climate model. The method is shown to yield a near-perfect decomposition of change into partial temperature contributions pertaining to forcing and each of the feedbacks. In the studied model water vapor feedback stands for about half the temperature change, CO2-forcing about one third, while cloud and surface albedo feedback contributions are relatively small. We find a close correspondence between forcing, feedback and partial surface temperature response for the water vapor and surface albedo feedbacks, while the cloud feedback is inefficient in inducing surface temperature change. Analysis suggests that cloud-induced warming in the upper tropical troposphere, consistent with rising convective cloud anvils in a warming climate enhances the negative lapse-rate feedback, thereby offsetting some of the warming that would otherwise be attributable to this positive cloud feedback. By subsequently combining feedback mechanisms we find a positive synergy acting between the water vapor feedback and the cloud feedback; that is, the combined cloud and water vapor feedback is greater than the sum of its parts. Negative synergies surround the surface albedo feedback, as associated cloud and water vapor changes dampen the anticipated climate change induced by retreating snow and ice. Our results highlight the importance of treating the coupling between clouds, water vapor and temperature in a deepening troposphere.},

Starting from complex climate models, a key difficulty is to be able to run long enough simulations in order to observe those extremely rare events. In physics, chemistry, and biology, rare event algorithms have recently been developed to compute probabilities of events that cannot be observed in direct numerical simulations. Here we propose such an algorithm, specifically designed for extreme heat or cold waves, based on statistical physics approaches. This gives an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in the sampling efficiency. We describe the dynamics of events that would not be observed otherwise. We show that European extreme heat waves are related to a global teleconnection pattern involving North America and Asia.

These measurements characterized aerosol microphysics, inferred chemistry, optical properties, and gases in several extensive dust and pollution plumes, also detected by satellites, which had 10,000‐km trajectories back to sources in Asia. Size‐resolved measurements indicative of aerosol sulfate, black carbon, dust, light scattering, and absorption allowed determination of their concentrations and contributions to column aerosol optical depth. A new Chemical Transport Model (CTM) that includes aerosol, meteorological fields, dynamics, gas and particle source emissions, a chemistry component (MATCH), and assimilated satellite data was used to predict aerosol and gas concentrations and the aerosol optical effects along our flight path. Flight measurements confirmed the “river‐like” plume structures predicted by the CTM and showed close agreement with the predicted contributions of dust and sulfate to aerosol concentrations and optical properties for this global‐scale transport path. Consistency between satellite, model and in situ assessment of aerosol optical depth was found, with noted exceptions, within ∼25\%. Both observations and model results confirmed that this aerosol was being entrained into the marine boundary layer between Hawaii and California where it can be expected to modify the type and concentration of cloud condensation nuclei in ways that may alter properties of low‐level clouds. These observations document the significance and complexity of long‐range aerosol transport and highlight the potential of emerging CTM models to extend observational data and address related issues on global scales.},

The large number of ensemble members (15-20) in each of the new LEs enables regional impacts of AER and GHG to be isolated from the noise of the model’s internal variability. Our analysis approach, based on running 50-year trends, accommodates geographical and temporal changes in patterns of forcing and response.AER are shown to be the primary driver of large-scale patterns of externally-forced trends in ALL before the late 1970s, and GHG to dominate thereafter. The AER and GHG forced trends are spatially distinct except during the 1970s transition phase when aerosol changes are mainly confined to lower latitudes. The transition phase is also characterized by a relative minimum in the amplitude of forced trend patterns in ALL, due to a combination of reduced AER and partially offsetting effects of AER and GHG. Internal variability greatly limits the detectability of AER- and GHG-forced trend patterns in individual realizations based on pattern correlation metrics, especially during the historical period, highlighting the need for LEs. We estimate that {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}\&lt; 20{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}\% of the spatial variances of observed precipitation and SST trends are attributable to AER and GHG forcing, though model biases in patterns of forced response and signal-to-noise may affect this estimate.\}},

In this paper, we address this shortcoming by introducing an open-source, reproducible benchmarking platform for symbolic regression. We assess 14 symbolic regression methods and 7 machine learning methods on a set of 252 diverse regression problems. Our assessment includes both real-world datasets with no known model form as well as ground-truth benchmark problems, including physics equations and systems of ordinary differential equations. For the real-world datasets, we benchmark the ability of each method to learn models with low error and low complexity relative to state-of-the-art machine learning methods. For the synthetic problems, we assess each method's ability to find exact solutions in the presence of varying levels of noise. Under these controlled experiments, we conclude that the best performing methods for real-world regression combine genetic algorithms with parameter estimation and/or semantic search drivers. When tasked with recovering exact equations in the presence of noise, we find that deep learning and genetic algorithm-based approaches perform similarly. We provide a detailed guide to reproducing this experiment and contributing new methods, and encourage other researchers to collaborate with us on a common and living symbolic regression benchmark.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the radical species OH and HO2 were made using the fluorescence assay by gas expansion (FAGE) technique during a series of night-time and daytime flights over the UK in summer 2010 and winter 2011. OH was not detected above the instrument's 1σ limit of detection during any of the night-time flights or during the winter daytime flights, placing upper limits on [OH] of 1.8 × 106 molecule cm−3 and 6.4 × 105 molecule cm−3 for the summer and winter flights, respectively. HO2 reached a maximum concentration of 3.2 × 108 molecule cm−3 (13.6 pptv) during a night-time flight on 20 July 2010, when the highest concentrations of NO3 and O3 were also recorded. An analysis of the rates of reaction of OH, O3, and the NO3 radical with measured alkenes indicates that the summer night-time troposphere can be as important for the processing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as the winter daytime troposphere. An analysis of the instantaneous rate of production of HO2 from the reactions of O3 and NO3 with alkenes has shown that, on average, reactions of NO3 dominated the night-time production of HO2 during summer and reactions of O3 dominated the night-time HO2 production during winter.},

Here, the relevant measurements including the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation spectrum, updraft velocity, cloud microphysical and aerosol properties are presented. It is shown that calculations of droplet concentration based on updraft velocity and the CCN activation spectrum are consistent with direct observations. Also discussed is an apparent disparity among measurements of the CCN activation spectrum, the accumulation mode size distribution, and the composition of the submicrometric aerosol. The observed consistency between CCN, updraft and cloud droplets is a necessary refinement; however, extended analyses of the ACE-2 data set are needed to guide improvements in model simulations of the interaction between aerosols and cloud microphysics. In particular, there is need for an examination of aerosol size spectra and chemical composition measurements with a view towards validating droplet activation schemes which relate the aerosol and cloud dynamical properties to cloud albedo.},

	abstract = {The European Aerosol Research Lidar Network, EARLINET, was founded in 2000 as a research project for establishing a quantitative, comprehensive, and statistically significant database for the horizontal, vertical, and temporal distribution of aerosols on a continental scale. Since then EARLINET has continued to provide the most extensive collection of ground-based data for the aerosol vertical distribution over Europe. This paper gives an overview of the network's main developments since 2000 and introduces the dedicated EARLINET special issue, which reports on the present innovative and comprehensive technical solutions and scientific results related to the use of advanced lidar remote sensing techniques for the study of aerosol properties as developed within the network in the last 13 years. Since 2000, EARLINET has developed greatly in terms of number of stations and spatial distribution: from 17 stations in 10 countries in 2000 to 27 stations in 16 countries in 2013. EARLINET has developed greatly also in terms of technological advances with the spread of advanced multiwavelength Raman lidar stations in Europe. The developments for the quality assurance strategy, the optimization of instruments and data processing, and the dissemination of data have contributed to a significant improvement of the network towards a more sustainable observing system, with an increase in the observing capability and a reduction of operational costs. Consequently, EARLINET data have already been extensively used for many climatological studies, long-range transport events, Saharan dust outbreaks, plumes from volcanic eruptions, and for model evaluation and satellite data validation and integration. Future plans are aimed at continuous measurements and near-real-time data delivery in close cooperation with other ground-based networks, such as in the ACTRIS (Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure Network) www.actris.net, and with the modeling and satellite community, linking the research community with the operational world, with the aim of establishing of the atmospheric part of the European component of the integrated global observing system.},

	abstract = {Here, we use 16‐year satellite and reanalysis data in combination with a multivariate regression model to investigate how aerosols affect cloud fraction (CF) over the East Coast of the United States. Cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd), cloud geometrical thickness, lower tropospheric stability, and relative humidity at 950 hPa (RH950) are identified as major cloud controlling parameters that explain 97\% of the variability in CF. Nd is shown to play an important role in regulating the dependence of CF on RH950. The observed annual‐mean CF shows no significant trend due to the cancellation from the opposite trends in Nd and RH950. The multivariate regression model revealed that the decline in Nd alone would lead to about a 20\% relative decline in CF. Our results indicate the significant aerosol effects on CF and suggest the need to account for pollution‐induced cloud changes in quantifying cloud feedback based on long‐term observations. Understanding how aerosols affect cloud cover is critical for reducing the large uncertainty of the radiative forcing associated with aerosol‐cloud interactions for future climate projections. By choosing a region (East Coast of the United States) that has experienced a significant decline in cloud droplet number concentrations due to pollution control in recent decades, we quantify aerosol effects on cloud amount based on long‐term satellite observation and reanalysis data in combination with a statistical regression model that isolates aerosol effects from meteorology influences.

Previous work (Kim et al., 2022) shows that with proper position embedding, GT can approximate MPNN arbitrarily well, implying that GT is at least as powerful as MPNN. In this paper, we study the inverse connection and show that MPNN with virtual node (VN), a commonly used heuristic with little theoretical understanding, is powerful enough to arbitrarily approximate the self-attention layer of GT. In particular, we first show that if we consider one type of linear transformer, the so-called Performer/Linear Transformer (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), then MPNN + VN with only O(1) depth and O(1) width can approximate a self-attention layer in Performer/Linear Transformer. Next, via a connection between MPNN + VN and DeepSets, we prove the MPNN + VN with O(n{\textasciicircum}d) width and O(1) depth can approximate the self-attention layer arbitrarily well, where d is the input feature dimension. Lastly, under some assumptions, we provide an explicit construction of MPNN + VN with O(1) width and O(n) depth approximating the self-attention layer in GT arbitrarily well. On the empirical side, we demonstrate that 1) MPNN + VN is a surprisingly strong baseline, outperforming GT on the recently proposed Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) dataset, 2) our MPNN + VN improves over early implementation on a wide range of OGB datasets and 3) MPNN + VN outperforms Linear Transformer and MPNN on the climate modeling task.},

Representation of aerosol–cloud interactions in global models is particularly challenging because these interactions occur on typically unresolved scales. Observational studies show influences of aerosol on clouds, but correlations between aerosol and clouds are insufficient to constrain aerosol forcing because of the difficulty in separating aerosol and meteorological impacts. In this commentary, we argue that this current impasse may be overcome with the development of approaches to conduct control experiments whereby aerosol particle perturbations can be introduced into patches of marine low clouds in a systematic manner. Such cloud perturbation experiments constitute a fresh approach to climate science and would provide unprecedented data to untangle the effects of aerosol particles on cloud microphysics and the resulting reflection of solar radiation by clouds. The control experiments would provide a critical test of high‐resolution models that are used to develop an improved representation aerosol–cloud interactions needed to better constrain aerosol forcing in global climate models.

	abstract = {The Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) simulates a high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS {\textgreater} 5°C) and a Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) that is substantially colder than proxy temperatures. In this study, we examine the role of cloud parameterizations in simulating the LGM cooling in CESM2. Through substituting different versions of cloud schemes in the atmosphere model, we attribute the excessive LGM cooling to the new CESM2 schemes of cloud microphysics and ice nucleation. Further exploration suggests that removing an inappropriate limiter on cloud ice number (NoNimax) and decreasing the time‐step size (substepping) in cloud microphysics largely eliminate the excessive LGM cooling. NoNimax produces a more physically consistent treatment of mixed‐phase clouds, which leads to an increase in cloud ice content and a weaker shortwave cloud feedback over mid‐to‐high latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere subtropics. Microphysical substepping further weakens the shortwave cloud feedback. Based on NoNimax and microphysical substepping, we have developed a paleoclimate‐calibrated CESM2 (PaleoCalibr), which simulates well the observed twentieth century warming and spatial characteristics of key cloud and climate variables. PaleoCalibr has a lower ECS (∼4°C) and a 20\% weaker aerosol‐cloud interaction than CESM2. PaleoCalibr represents a physically more consistent treatment of cloud microphysics than CESM2 and is a valuable tool in climate change studies, especially when a large climate forcing is involved. Our study highlights the unique value of paleoclimate constraints in informing the cloud parameterizations and ultimately the future climate projection. The Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) shows a much higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS {\textgreater} 5°C) than its predecessor models (≤4°C), which, if true, implies a greater future warming than previously thought and a more severe challenge for climate adaptation and mitigation. It is critical to determine whether the high ECS is realistic and what causes its increase. In a previous study, we suggested that the high ECS is likely unrealistic because CESM2 simulates excessive cooling for an ice age climate—the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ∼21,000 years ago). In this study, we investigate which aspects of CESM2 are responsible for the extreme LGM cooling and the high ECS. We find that the simulated LGM climate is very sensitive to treatments of cloud microphysical processes, and that removing an inappropriate limiter on cloud ice number and using a smaller time‐step size in the microphysics largely eliminate the excessive LGM cooling. With these microphysical modifications, CESM2 simulates a much lower ECS (∼4°C) and matches present‐day observations well. Our study suggests that an ECS {\textgreater} 5°C is likely unrealistic and highlights the importance of using past climates to inform and validate the model development including the treatment of clouds. Excessive Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) cooling and an ECS {\textgreater} 5°C in Community Earth System Model version 2 are attributed to cloud microphysical processes including ice nucleation A new configuration (PaleoCalibr) is developed that removes an inappropriate cloud‐ice‐number limiter and decreases microphysical timestep PaleoCalibr simulates realistic LGM and modern climates, a lower ECS (3.9°C), and a weaker shortwave cloud feedback Excessive Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) cooling and an ECS {\textgreater} 5°C in Community Earth System Model version 2 are attributed to cloud microphysical processes including ice nucleation A new configuration (PaleoCalibr) is developed that removes an inappropriate cloud‐ice‐number limiter and decreases microphysical timestep PaleoCalibr simulates realistic LGM and modern climates, a lower ECS (3.9°C), and a weaker shortwave cloud feedback},

The classifier, used in prior studies, distinguishes closed, open, and cellular, but disorganized MCC. This work uses trajectories in four eastern subtropical ocean basins to compare meteorological variables and the structures of boundary layers for trajectories that begin as closed cells, but evolve either into open cells, disorganized cells, or remain closed cells over one afternoon-afternoon cycle. Results show contrasts between the trajectory sets: Trajectories for MCC that remain closed cells are more frequently observed nearer coasts, while trajectories that break into open and disorganized cells begin farther offshore. The frequency at which closed cells transition to open cells is seasonally invariant. The fraction of trajectories that stay as closed MCC varies throughout the year in opposition to those that break into disorganized cells, so that their annual cycles are 180° out of phase. Trajectories remain as closed cell more frequently in austral spring and boreal summer when the trade inversion is stronger. The closed-disorganized MCC breakup is associated with weaker subsidence, a weaker inversion, a drier free troposphere, and enhanced nighttime boundary layer deepening, consistent with a warming-drying mechanism. The closed-open transition occurs in meteorological conditions similar to closed-closed trajectories. However, prior to the transition, the closed-open trajectories exhibit stronger surface winds, lower cloud droplet concentrations, and rain more heavily overnight. Results suggest that multiple, independent mechanisms drive changes in cloud amount and morphology.},

It features a nested large-eddy simulation in a hindcasting mode that allows a direct comparison between simulations and observations. Using this approach, we simulated two stratocumulus cases observed at the southern Great Plains observing site. The simulation-observation comparisons demonstrate that the multiple nested WRF well reproduces the cloud properties and vertical velocity fields detected by cloud radar and other remote sensing instruments. The simulations show that (1) the cloud fields can be strongly modulated by mesoscale organizations; (2) the vertical velocity variance and skewness in the boundary layer have well-defined diurnal variations and are strongly dependent on external forcings, but the in-cloud turbulent statistics appears to be more controlled by the internal turbulent processes; (3) the organized structures of stratocumulus are only slightly skewed, which is consistent with the cloud radar observations that the updraft fraction is close to 50\%; and (4) the vertical distribution of cloud water and the associated high-order moments of continental stratocumulus can be substantially different from its marine counterpart due to different ambient thermodynamic structures. This study suggests that the multiple-scale WRF modeling system provides a great numerical framework that can be used to address various issues regarding the parameterization of boundary layer clouds.},

The study obtains a consistent long-term Earth system heat gain over the period 1971–2018, with a total heat gain of 358±37 ZJ, which is equivalent to a global heating rate of 0.47±0.1 W m-2. Over the period 1971–2018 (2010–2018), the majority of heat gain is reported for the global ocean with 89 \% (90 \%), with 52 \% for both periods in the upper 700 m depth, 28 \% (30 \%) for the 700–2000 m depth layer and 9 \% (8 \%) below 2000 m depth. Heat gain over land amounts to 6 \% (5 \%) over these periods, 4 \% (3 \%) is available for the melting of grounded and floating ice, and 1 \% (2 \%) is available for atmospheric warming. Our results also show that EEI is not only continuing, but also increasing: the EEI amounts to 0.87±0.12 W m-2 during 2010–2018. Stabilization of climate, the goal of the universally agreed United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and the Paris Agreement in 2015, requires that EEI be reduced to approximately zero to achieve Earth's system quasi-equilibrium. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would need to be reduced from 410 to 353 ppm to increase heat radiation to space by 0.87 W m-2, bringing Earth back towards energy balance. This simple number, EEI, is the most fundamental metric that the scientific community and public must be aware of as the measure of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing climate change under control, and we call for an implementation of the EEI into the global stocktake based on best available science. Continued quantification and reduced uncertainties in the Earth heat inventory can be best achieved through the maintenance of the current global climate observing system, its extension into areas of gaps in the sampling, and the establishment of an international framework for concerted multidisciplinary research of the Earth heat inventory as presented in this study.

	abstract = {Top-down constraints on global sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions are inferred through inverse modeling using SO2 column observations from two satellite instruments (SCIAMACHY and OMI). We first evaluated the SO2 column observations with surface SO2 measurements by applying local scaling factors from a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to SO2 columns retrieved from the satellite instruments. The resulting annual mean surface SO2 mixing ratios for 2006 exhibit a significant spatial correlation (r = 0.86, slope = 0.91 for SCIAMACHY and r = 0.80, slope = 0.79 for OMI) with coincident in situ measurements from monitoring networks throughout the United States and Canada. We evaluate the GEOS-Chem simulation of the SO2 lifetime with that inferred from in situ measurements to verify the applicability of GEOS-Chem for inversion of SO2 columns to emissions. The seasonal mean SO2 lifetime calculated with the GEOS-Chem model over the eastern United States is 13 h in summer and 48 h in winter, compared to lifetimes inferred from in situ measurements of 19 ± 7 h in summer and 58 ± 20 h in winter. We apply SO2 columns from SCIAMACHY and OMI to derive a top-down anthropogenic SO2 emission inventory over land by using the local GEOS-Chem relationship between SO2 columns and emissions. There is little seasonal variation in the top-down emissions ({\textless}15\%) over most major industrial regions providing some confidence in the method. Our global estimate for annual land surface anthropogenic SO2 emissions (52.4 Tg S yr−1 from SCIAMACHY and 49.9 Tg S yr−1 from OMI) closely agrees with the bottom-up emissions (54.6 Tg S yr−1) in the GEOS-Chem model and exhibits consistency in global distributions with the bottom-up emissions (r = 0.78 for SCIAMACHY, and r = 0.77 for OMI). However, there are significant regional differences.},

	abstract = {The semi-permanent stratocumulus clouds over the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean (SEA) can act as an “air conditioner” to the regional and global climate system. The interaction of aerosols and clouds becomes important in this region and can lead to negative radiative effects, partially offsetting the positive radiative forcing of greenhouse gases. A key pathway by which aerosols affect cloud properties is by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). In this paper, we use the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1) to investigate the sources of CCN (from emissions and atmospheric processes) in the SEA as well as the response of the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the cloud liquid water path (LWP), and radiative forcing to these sources during 2016 and 2017. Overall, free and upper troposphere nucleated aerosols are the dominant source of the boundary layer CCN concentration at 0.2 \% supersaturation (CCN0.2\%), contributing an annual average of ∼ 41 \% as they subside and entrain into the marine boundary layer, which is consistent with observations highlighting the important role of nucleation in the boundary layer CCN concentration. In terms of emission sources, anthropogenic emissions (from energy, industry, agriculture, etc.) contribute the most to the annual average CCN0.2\% in the marine boundary layer (∼ 26 \%), followed by biomass burning (BB, ∼ 17 \%). In the cloud layer, BB contributes about 34 \% of the annual CCN0.2\%, midway between the contributions from aerosol nucleation (36 \%) and anthropogenic sources (31 \%). The contribution of aerosols from different sources to the CDNC is consistent with their contribution to CCN0.2\% within the marine boundary layer, with free and upper troposphere aerosol nucleation being the most important source of the CDNC overall. In terms of emission sources, anthropogenic sources are also the largest contributors to the annual average CDNC, closely followed by BB. However, during the BB season, BB and free and upper troposphere aerosol nucleation are equally the most important sources of the CDNC. The contribution of BB to the CDNC is more significant than its increase to CCN0.2\%, mainly because BB aerosols are mostly located directly above the inversion layer in the model; thus, they can increase the in-cloud CDNC by enhancing the supersaturation through the dynamical feedback due to short-wave absorption. An aerosol source that shows an increase in the CDNC also shows an increase in the LWP resulting from a reduction in autoconversion. Due to the absorption effect, BB aerosol can enhance existing temperature inversions and reduce the entrainment of sub-saturated air, leading to a further increase in the LWP. As a result, the contribution of BB to the LWP is second only to aerosol nucleation on annual averages. These findings demonstrate that BB is not the dominant source of CCN within the marine boundary layer from an emission source perspective. However, as most BB aerosols are located directly above the inversion layer, their effect on clouds increases due to their absorption effect (about the same as anthropogenic sources for the CDNC and more than anthropogenic sources for the LWP), highlighting the crucial role of their radiative effect on clouds. The results on the radiative effects of aerosols show that BB aerosol exhibits an overall positive RFari (radiative forcing associated with aerosol–radiation interactions), but its net effective radiative forcing remains negative due to its effect on clouds (mainly due to its absorbing effect). By quantifying aerosol and cloud properties affected by different sources, this paper provides a framework for understanding the effects of aerosol sources on marine stratocumulus clouds and radiation in the SEA.},

Identical twin experiments demonstrate that this method can retrieve default values of the control parameters when using a long assimilation window of the order of 2 months. Chaos synchronization through nudging, required to overcome limits in the temporal assimilation window in the adjoint method, is employed successfully to reach this assimilation window length. When assimilating ERA‐Interim reanalysis data, the observations of air temperature and the radiative fluxes are the most important data for adjusting the control parameters. The global mean net longwave fluxes at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere are significantly improved by tuning two model parameters controlling the absorption of clouds and water vapor. The global mean net shortwave radiation at the surface is improved by optimizing three model parameters controlling cloud optical properties. The optimized parameters improve the free model (without nudging terms) simulation in a way similar to that in the assimilation experiments. Results suggest a promising way for tuning uncertain parameters in nonlinear coupled climate models.},

Modeled and observed global median N4–12 and N12 agree fairly well (within a factor of two) indicating that the relatively simplified binary H2SO4-H2O nucleation parameterization applied in the model produces reasonable results in the UT/LMS. However, a comparison of the spatiotemporal distribution of sub-micrometer particles displays a number of discrepancies between MIT-CAM3 and CARIBIC data: N4–12is underestimated by the model in the tropics and overestimated in the extra-topics. N12 is in general overestimated by the model, in particular in the tropics and during summer months. The modeled seasonal variability of N4–12 is in poor agreement with CARIBIC data whereas it agrees rather well for N12. Modeled particle frequency distributions are in general narrower than the observed ones. The model biases indicate an insufficient diffusive mixing in MIT-CAM3 and a too large vertical transport of carbonaceous aerosols. The overestimated transport is most likely caused by the constant supersaturation threshold applied in the model for the activation of particles into cloud droplets. The annually constant SO2 emissions in the model may also partly explain the poor representation of the N4–12seasonal cycle. Comparing the MIT-CAM3 with CARIBIC data, it is also clear that care has to be taken regarding the representativeness of the measurement data and the time frequency of the model output.},

Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments.

This was the first aircraft deployment of the HR-ToF-AMS. During the campaign the instrument performed very well, and provided 12 s data. The aerosol mass from the AMS correlates strongly with other aerosol measurements on board the aircraft. Organic aerosol (OA) species dominate the NR-PM1 mass. OA correlates strongly with CO and HCN indicating that pollution (mostly secondary OA, SOA) and biomass burning (BB) are the main OA sources. The OA to CO ratio indicates a typical value for aged air of around 80 μg m−3 (STP) ppm−1. This is within the range observed in outflow from the Northeastern US, which could be due to a compensating effect between higher BB but lower biogenic VOC emissions during this study. The O/C atomic ratio for OA is calculated from the HR mass spectra and shows a clear increase with photochemical age, as SOA forms rapidly and quickly overwhelms primary urban OA, consistent with Volkamer et al. (2006) and Kleinman et al. (2008). The stability of the OA/CO while O/C increases with photochemical age implies a net loss of carbon from the OA. BB OA is marked by signals at m/z 60 and 73, and also by a signal enhancement at large m/z indicative of larger molecules or more resistance to fragmentation. The main inorganic components show different spatial patterns and size distributions. Sulfate is regional in nature with clear volcanic and petrochemical/power plant sources, while the urban area is not a major regional source for this species. Nitrate is enhanced significantly in the urban area and immediate outflow, and is strongly correlated with CO indicating a strong urban source. The importance of nitrate decreases with distance from the city likely due to evaporation. BB does not appear to be a strong source of nitrate despite its high emissions of nitrogen oxides, presumably due to low ammonia emissions. NR-chloride often correlates with HCN indicating a fire source, although other sources likely contribute as well. This is the first aircraft study of the regional evolution of aerosol chemistry from a tropical megacity.},

	abstract = {The incoming solar radiation is the essential climate variable that determines the Earth's energy cycle and climate. As long-term high-quality surface measurements of solar radiation are rare, satellite data are used to derive more information on its spatial pattern and its temporal variability. Recently, the EUMETSAT Satellite Application on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) has published two satellite-based climate data records: Surface Solar Radiation Data Set-Heliosat, Edition 2 (SARAH-2), and Clouds and Radiation Data Set based on AVHRR (advanced very high resolution radiometer) Satellite Measurements, Edition 2 (CLARA-A2). Both data records provide estimates of surface solar radiation. In this study, these new climate data records are compared to surface measurements in Europe during the period 1983–2015. SARAH-2 and CLARA-A2 show a high accuracy compared to ground-based observations (mean absolute deviations of 6.9 and 7.3 W/m2, respectively) highlighting a good agreement considering the temporal behavior and the spatial distribution. The results show an overall brightening period since the 1980s onward (comprised between 1.9 and 2.4 W/m2/decade), with substantial decadal and spatial variability. The strongest brightening is found in eastern Europe in spring. An exception is found for northern and southern Europe, where the trends shown by the station data are not completely reproduced by satellite data, especially in summer in southern Europe. We conclude that the major part of the observed trends in surface solar radiation in Europe is caused by changes in clouds and that remaining differences between the satellite- and the station-based data might be connected to changes in the direct aerosol effect and in snow cover.},

This work, with the example of the model used in the updated version of the weather@home distributed climate model framework, shows the potential for improving climate model simulations through a multiphased parameter refinement approach, particularly over the northwestern United States (NWUS). Each phase consists of (1) creating a perturbed parameter ensemble with the coupled global–regional atmospheric model, (2) building statistical emulators that estimate climate metrics as functions of parameter values, (3) and using the emulators to further refine the parameter space. The refinement process includes sensitivity analyses to identify the most influential parameters for various model output metrics; results are then used to cull parameters with little influence. Three phases of this iterative process are carried out before the results are considered to be satisfactory; that is, a handful of parameter sets are identified that meet acceptable bias reduction criteria. Results not only indicate that 74\&amp;thinsp;\% of the NWUS regional warm biases can be reduced by refining global atmospheric parameters that control convection and hydrometeor transport, as well as land surface parameters that affect plant photosynthesis, transpiration, and evaporation, but also suggest that this iterative approach to perturbed parameters has an important role to play in the evolution of physical parameterizations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We identify, compare and develop three subfamilies of ensemble methods that differ in the objective they seek to minimize and the derivative-based optimization scheme they approximate through the ensemble. Our work emphasizes two principles for the derivation and analysis of iterative ensemble Kalman methods: statistical linearization and continuum limits. Following these guiding principles, we introduce new iterative ensemble Kalman methods that show promising numerical performance in Bayesian inverse problems, data assimilation and machine learning tasks.},

	abstract = {The Angstrom wavelength exponent α, which is the slope of the logarithm of aerosol optical depth (τa) versus the logarithm of wavelength (λ), is commonly used to characterize the wavelength dependence of τa and to provide some basic information on the aerosol size distribution. This parameter is frequently computed from the spectral measurements of both ground-based sunphotometers and from satellite and aircraft remote sensing retrievals. However, spectral variation of α is typically not considered in the analysis and comparison of values from different techniques. We analyze the spectral measurements of τa from 340 to 1020 nm obtained from ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network radiometers located in various locations where either biomass burning, urban, or desert dust aerosols are prevalent. Aerosol size distribution retrievals obtained from combined solar extinction and sky radiance measurements are also utilized in the analysis. These data show that there is significant curvature in the ln τa versus ln λ relationship for aerosol size distributions dominated by accumulation mode aerosols (biomass burning and urban). Mie theory calculations of α for biomass burning smoke (for a case of aged smoke at high optical depth) agree well with observations, confirming that large spectral variations in α are due to the dominance of accumulation mode aerosols. A second order polynomial fit to the ln τa versus ln λ data provides excellent agreement with differences in τa of the order of the uncertainty in the measurements (∼0.01-0.02). The significant curvature in ln τa versus ln λ for high optical depth accumulation mode dominated aerosols results in α values differing by a factor of 3–5 from 340 to 870 nm. We characterize the curvature in ln τa versus ln λ by the second derivative α′ and suggest that this parameter be utilized in conjunction with α to characterize the spectral dependence of τa. The second derivative of ln τa versus ln λ gives an indication of the relative influence of accumulation mode versus coarse mode particles on optical properties.},

	abstract = {Some of the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is offset by increased reflection of solar radiation by clouds with smaller droplets that form in air polluted with aerosol particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei1. The resulting cooling tendency, termed the indirect aerosol forcing, is thought to be comparable in magnitude to the forcing by anthropogenic CO2, but it is difficult to estimate because the physical processes that determine global aerosol and cloud populations are poorly understood2. Smaller cloud droplets not only reflect sunlight more effectively, but also inhibit precipitation, which is expected to result in increased cloud water3,4. Such an increase in cloud water would result in even more reflective clouds, further increasing the indirect forcing. Marine boundary-layer clouds polluted by aerosol particles, however, are not generally observed to hold more water5,6,7. Here we simulate stratocumulus clouds with a fluid dynamics model that includes detailed treatments of cloud microphysics and radiative transfer. Our simulations show that the response of cloud water to suppression of precipitation from increased droplet concentrations is determined by a competition between moistening from decreased surface precipitation and drying from increased entrainment of overlying air. Only when the overlying air is humid or droplet concentrations are very low does sufficient precipitation reach the surface to allow cloud water to increase with droplet concentrations. Otherwise, the response of cloud water to aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation is dominated by enhanced entrainment of overlying dry air. In this scenario, cloud water is reduced as droplet concentrations increase, which diminishes the indirect climate forcing.},

	abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol contributes to the atmospheric particle burden with implications for air quality and climate. Biogenic volatile organic compounds such as terpenoids emitted from plants are important secondary organic aerosol precursors with isoprene dominating the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds globally. However, the particle mass from isoprene oxidation is generally modest compared to that of other terpenoids. Here we show that isoprene, carbon monoxide and methane can each suppress the instantaneous mass and the overall mass yield derived from monoterpenes in mixtures of atmospheric vapours. We find that isoprene ‘scavenges’ hydroxyl radicals, preventing their reaction with monoterpenes, and the resulting isoprene peroxy radicals scavenge highly oxygenated monoterpene products. These effects reduce the yield of low-volatility products that would otherwise form secondary organic aerosol. Global model calculations indicate that oxidant and product scavenging can operate effectively in the real atmosphere. Thus highly reactive compounds (such as isoprene) that produce a modest amount of aerosol are not necessarily net producers of secondary organic particle mass and their oxidation in mixtures of atmospheric vapours can suppress both particle number and mass of secondary organic aerosol. We suggest that formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere need to be considered more realistically, accounting for mechanistic interactions between the products of oxidizing precursor molecules (as is recognized to be necessary when modelling ozone production). Adding reactive gases such as isoprene to mixtures lowers the production of secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere, thus reducing the atmospheric particulate burden, with implications for human health and climate.},

Thanks to ongoing efforts, now there exists a tremendous amount of atmospheric data, obtained through continuous measurements directly from the atmosphere. This fact makes the analysis by human brains difficult but, on the other hand, enables the usage of modern data science techniques. Here, we calculate and explore the mutual information (MI) between observed NPF events (measured at Hyytiälä, Finland) and a wide variety of simultaneously monitored ambient variables: trace gas and aerosol particle concentrations, meteorology, radiation and a few derived quantities. The purpose of the investigations is to identify key factors contributing to the NPF. The applied mutual information method finds that the formation events are strongly linked to sulfuric acid concentration and water content, ultraviolet radiation, condensation sink (CS) and temperature. Previously, these quantities have been well-established to be important players in the phenomenon via dedicated field, laboratory and theoretical research. The novelty of this work is to demonstrate that the same results are now obtained by a data analysis method which operates without supervision and without the need of understanding the physics deeply. This suggests that the method is suitable to be implemented widely in the atmospheric field to discover other interesting phenomena and their relevant variables.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The main objective of this work is the determination of the maximum steady-state supersaturation within a thermal diffusion chamber. This required analysis of the uncertainties associated with the calibration of the instrument’s plate temperature and light scattering measurement systems. The fraction of test particles activating to form cloud droplets, the activated fraction, was evaluated over a range of dry particle diameters at four supersaturations. Values of both the particle size, corresponding to an activated fraction equal to 0.5, and the width of a fitted activation function were derived. The former was used to evaluate the maximum steady-state chamber supersaturation. These studies reveal three significant findings. First, the derived chamber supersaturation is ∼40\% smaller than values based on temperature measured at the top and bottom of the diffusion chamber. Second, using deliquesced test particles, mobility selected at a prescribed relative humidity, it is shown that the 40\% discrepancy is not the result of a test particle shape effect. Third, the width of the activation function is substantially larger than the width of the test particle size spectra. Plausible explanations for the 40\% bias are considered. Contributors are the unintentional overestimation of the temperature difference imposed across the CCN chamber and the implicit assumption that water at the top and bottom of the CCN chamber has a vapor pressure equal to that over pure water.},

Recently, machine-learning models trained on reanalysis data have achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting3,4. However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present a GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best machine-learning and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with machine-learning models for one- to ten-day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for one- to fifteen-day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140-kilometre resolution show emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs, although our model does not extrapolate to substantially different future climates. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.},

Warm rain is very infrequent over the continents, with significant warm rain found only in onshore flow in the tropics, and over India, China, and Indochina. Comparison of the properties of precipitating and nonprecipitating warm clouds shows that the scarcity of warm rain over land can be explained by smaller effective radii in continental clouds that delay the onset of precipitation.

The equilibrium climate sensitivity is defined as the temperature increase because of a doubling of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere when the climate reaches a new steady state. CO2 is only one out of the several external factors that affect the global temperature, called radiative forcing mechanisms as a collective term. In this paper, we present a model framework for estimating the climate sensitivity. The core of the model is a simple, deterministic climate model based on elementary physical laws such as energy balance. It models yearly hemispheric surface temperature and global ocean heat content as a function of historical radiative forcing. This deterministic model is combined with an empirical, stochastic model and fitted to observations on global temperature and ocean heat content, conditioned on estimates of historical radiative forcing. We use a Bayesian framework, with informative priors on a subset of the parameters and flat priors on the climate sensitivity and the remaining parameters. The model is estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {High‐Resolution Multi‐scale Modeling Frameworks (HR)—global climate models that embed separate, convection‐resolving models with high enough resolution to resolve boundary layer eddies—have exciting potential for investigating low cloud feedback dynamics due to reduced parameterization and ability for multidecadal throughput on modern computing hardware. However low clouds in past HR have suffered a stubborn problem of over‐entrainment due to an uncontrolled source of mixing across the marine subtropical inversion manifesting as stratocumulus dim biases in present‐day climate, limiting their scientific utility. We report new results showing that this over‐entrainment can be partly offset by using hyperviscosity and cloud droplet sedimentation. Hyperviscosity damps small‐scale momentum fluctuations associated with the formulation of the momentum solver of the embedded large eddy simulation. By considering the sedimentation process adjacent to default one‐moment microphysics in HR, condensed phase particles can be removed from the entrainment zone, which further reduces entrainment efficiency. The result is an HR that can produce more low clouds with a higher liquid water path and a reduced stratocumulus dim bias. Associated improvements in the explicitly simulated sub‐cloud eddy spectrum are observed. We report these sensitivities in multi‐week tests and then explore their operational potential alongside microphysical retuning in decadal simulations at operational 1.5° exterior resolution. The result is a new HR having desired improvements in the baseline present‐day low cloud climatology, and a reduced global mean bias and root mean squared error of absorbed shortwave radiation. We suggest it should be promising for examining low cloud feedbacks with minimal approximation. Stratocumulus clouds cover a large fraction of the globe but are very challenging to reproduce in computer simulations of Earth's atmosphere because of their unique complexity. Previous studies find the model produces too few Stratocumulus clouds as we increase the model resolution, which, in theory, should improve the simulation of important motions for the clouds. This is because the clouds are exposed to more conditions that make them evaporate away. On Earth, stratocumulus clouds reflect a lot of sunlight. In the computer model of Earth, too much sunlight reaches the surface because of too few stratocumulus clouds, which makes it warmer. This study tests two methods to thicken Stratocumulus clouds in the computer model Earth. The first method smooths out some winds, which helps reduce the exposure of clouds to the conditions that make them evaporate. The second method moves water droplets in the cloud away from the conditions that would otherwise make them evaporate. In long simulations, combining these methods helps the model produce thicker stratocumulus clouds with more water. We improve a long‐standing stratocumulus (Sc) dim bias in a high‐resolution Multiscale Modeling Framework Incorporating intra‐CRM hyperviscosity hedges against the numerics of its momentum solver, reducing entrainment vicinity Further adding sedimentation boosts Sc brightness close to observed, opening path to more faithful low cloud feedback analysis We improve a long‐standing stratocumulus (Sc) dim bias in a high‐resolution Multiscale Modeling Framework Incorporating intra‐CRM hyperviscosity hedges against the numerics of its momentum solver, reducing entrainment vicinity Further adding sedimentation boosts Sc brightness close to observed, opening path to more faithful low cloud feedback analysis},

The network finds the physically relevant parameters, exploits conservation laws to make predictions, and can be used to gain conceptual insights. For example, given a time series of the positions of the Sun and Mars as observed from Earth, the network discovers the heliocentric model of the solar system - that is, it encodes the data into the angles of the two planets as seen from the Sun. Our work provides a first step towards answering the question whether the traditional ways by which physicists model nature naturally arise from the experimental data without any mathematical and physical pre-knowledge, or if there are alternative elegant formalisms, which may solve some of the fundamental conceptual problems in modern physics, such as the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.},

The adjoint model is constructed from a combination of manually and automatically derived discrete adjoint algorithms and numerical solutions to continuous adjoint equations. Explicit inclusion of the processes that govern secondary formation of inorganic aerosol is shown to afford efficient calculation of model sensitivities such as the dependence of sulfate and nitrate aerosol concentrations on emissions of SOx, NOx, and NH3. The accuracy of the adjoint model is extensively verified by comparing adjoint to finite difference sensitivities, which are shown to agree within acceptable tolerances. We explore the robustness of these results, noting how discontinuities in the advection routine hinder, but do not entirely preclude, the use of such comparisons for validation of the adjoint model. The potential for inverse modeling using the adjoint of GEOS-Chem is assessed in a data assimilation framework using simulated observations, demonstrating the feasibility of exploiting gas- and aerosol-phase measurements for optimizing emission inventories of aerosol precursors.},

	abstract = {Natural aerosols and their interactions with clouds remain an important uncertainty within climate models, especially at the poles. Here, we study the behavior of sea salt aerosols (SSaer) in the Arctic and Antarctic within 12 climate models from CMIP6. We investigate the driving factors that control SSaer abundances and show large differences based on the choice of the source function, and the representation of aerosol processes in the atmosphere. Close to the poles, the CMIP6 models do not match observed seasonal cycles of surface concentrations, likely due to the absence of wintertime SSaer sources such as blowing snow. Further away from the poles, simulated concentrations have the correct seasonality, but have a positive mean bias of up to one order of magnitude. SSaer optical depth is derived from the MODIS data and compared to modeled values, revealing good agreement, except for winter months. Better agreement for aerosol optical depth than surface concentration may indicate a need for improving the vertical distribution, the size distribution and/or hygroscopicity of modeled polar SSaer. Source functions used in CMIP6 emit very different numbers of small SSaer, potentially exacerbating cloud‐aerosol interaction uncertainties in these remote regions. For future climate scenarios SSP126 and SSP585, we show that SSaer concentrations increase at both poles at the end of the 21st century, with more than two times mid‐20th century values in the Arctic. The pre‐industrial climate CMIP6 experiments suggest there is a large uncertainty in the polar radiative budget due to SSaer. Aerosols emitted from the ocean, such as sea salt particles (aerosols), are critical for the climate of polar regions. However, there is still uncertainty in their representation in climate models. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the representation of sea salt aerosols (SSaer) in the Arctic and Antarctic in a recent model inter‐comparison initiative, and to assess the consequences for our understanding of present‐day and future polar climate. We find that the models disagree between them and with observations from ground stations and from space. This suggests that the formulation of sea salt emissions in global models is not adapted for polar regions. With sea ice retreat, SSaer will most likely increase in the future, which makes addressing the current uncertainty an important next step for the scientific community. CMIP6 models have a large uncertainty in present day sea salt aerosol abundance at the poles Model performance is degraded closer to the poles suggesting inadequate emission sources within the polar regions Both present and future radiative balance at the poles is uncertain because of sea salt aerosols CMIP6 models have a large uncertainty in present day sea salt aerosol abundance at the poles Model performance is degraded closer to the poles suggesting inadequate emission sources within the polar regions Both present and future radiative balance at the poles is uncertain because of sea salt aerosols},

The DMS production and consumption processes in the ocean are simulated in the marine biogeochemistry model HAMOCC5, embedded in a ocean general circulation model (MPI-OM). The atmospheric model ECHAM5 is extended by the microphysical aerosol model HAM, treating the sulfur chemistry in the atmosphere and the evolution of the microphysically interacting internally- and externally mixed aerosol populations. We simulate a global annual mean DMS sea surface concentration of 1.8 nmol l−1, a DMS emission of 28 Tg(S) yr−1, a DMS burden in the atmosphere of 0.077 Tg(S), and a DMS lifetime of 1.0 days. To quantify the role of DMS in the atmospheric sulfur cycle we simulate the relative contribution of DMS-derived SO2 and SO42− to the total atmospheric sulfur concentrations. DMS contributes 25\% to the global annually averaged SO2 column burden. For SO42− the contribution is 27\%. The coupled model setup allows the evaluation of the simulated DMS quantities with measurements taken in the ocean and in the atmosphere. The simulated global distribution of DMS sea surface concentrations compares reasonably well with measurements. The comparison to SO42− surface concentration measurements in regions with a high DMS contribution to SO42− shows an overestimation by the model. This overestimation is most pronounced in the biologically active season with high DMS emissions and most likely caused by a too high simulated SO42− yield from DMS oxidation.},

	abstract = {Natural aerosols define a preindustrial baseline state from which the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol effects on climate are calculated and are a major component of the large uncertainty in anthropogenic aerosol−cloud radiative forcing. This uncertainty would be reduced if aerosol environments unperturbed by air pollution could be studied in the present-day atmosphere, but the pervasiveness of air pollution makes identification of unperturbed regions difficult. Here, we use global model simulations to define unperturbed aerosol regions in terms of two measures that compare 1750 and 2000 conditions—the number of days with similar aerosol concentrations and the similarity of the aerosol response to perturbations in model processes and emissions. The analysis shows that the aerosol system in many present-day environments looks and behaves like it did in the preindustrial era. On a global annual mean, unperturbed aerosol regions cover 12\% of the Earth (16\% of the ocean surface and 2\% of the land surface). There is a strong seasonal variation in unperturbed regions of between 4\% in August and 27\% in January, with the most persistent conditions occurring over the equatorial Pacific. About 90\% of unperturbed regions occur in the Southern Hemisphere, but in the Northern Hemisphere, unperturbed conditions are transient and spatially patchy. In cloudy regions with a radiative forcing relative to 1750, model results suggest that unperturbed aerosol conditions could still occur on a small number of days per month. However, these environments are mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, potentially limiting the usefulness in reducing Northern Hemisphere forcing uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Stratocumulus clouds are important for climate as they reflect large amounts of solar radiation back into space. However they are difficult to simulate in global climate models because they form under a sharp inversion and are thin. A comparison of model simulations with the ECHAM6-HAM2 global aerosol climate model to observations, reanalysis and literature data revealed too strong turbulent mixing at the top of stratocumulus clouds and a lack of vertical resolution. Further reasons for cloud biases in stratocumulus regions are the too "active" shallow convection scheme, the cloud cover scheme and possibly too low subsidence rates. To address some of these issues and improve the representation of stratocumulus clouds, we made three distinct changes to ECHAM6-HAM2. With a "sharp" stability function in the turbulent mixing scheme we have observed, similar to previous studies, increases in stratocumulus cloud cover and liquid water path. With an increased vertical resolution in the lower troposphere in ECHAM6-HAM2 the stratocumulus clouds form higher up in the atmosphere and their vertical extent agrees better with reanalysis data. The recently implemented in-cloud aerosol processing in stratiform clouds is used to improve the aerosol representation in the model. Including the improvements also affects the anthropogenic aerosol effect. In-cloud aerosol processing in ECHAM6-HAM2 leads to a decrease in the anthropogenic aerosol effect in the global annual mean from −1.19 Wm−2 in the reference simulation to −1.08 Wm−2, while using a "sharp" stability function leads to an increase to −1.34 Wm−2. The results from the simulations with increased vertical resolution are diverse but increase the anthropogenic aerosol effect to −2.08 Wm−2 at 47 levels and −2.30 Wm−2 at 95 levels.},

Atmospheric modeling is critical for understanding the long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic, as well as the abundance and distribution of SLCFs throughout the Arctic atmosphere. Modeling is also used as a tool to determine SLCF impacts on climate and health in the present and in future emissions scenarios. In this study, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art atmospheric and Earth system models by assessing their representation of Arctic and Northern Hemisphere atmospheric SLCF distributions, considering a wide range of different chemical species (methane, tropospheric ozone and its precursors, black carbon, sulfate, organic aerosol, and particulate matter) and multiple observational datasets. Model simulations over 4 years (2008–2009 and 2014–2015) conducted for the 2022 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) SLCF assessment report are thoroughly evaluated against satellite, ground, ship, and aircraft-based observations. The annual means, seasonal cycles, and 3-D distributions of SLCFs were evaluated using several metrics, such as absolute and percent model biases and correlation coefficients. The results show a large range in model performance, with no one particular model or model type performing well for all regions and all SLCF species. The multi-model mean (mmm) was able to represent the general features of SLCFs in the Arctic and had the best overall performance. For the SLCFs with the greatest radiative impact (CH4, O3, BC, and SO42-), the mmm was within ±25 \% of the measurements across the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, we recommend a multi-model ensemble be used for simulating climate and health impacts of SLCFs. Of the SLCFs in our study, model biases were smallest for CH4 and greatest for OA. For most SLCFs, model biases skewed from positive to negative with increasing latitude. Our analysis suggests that vertical mixing, long-range transport, deposition, and wildfires remain highly uncertain processes. These processes need better representation within atmospheric models to improve their simulation of SLCFs in the Arctic environment. As model development proceeds in these areas, we highly recommend that the vertical and 3-D distribution of SLCFs be evaluated, as that information is critical to improving the uncertain processes in models.},

Both the host atmospheric climate model ECHAM6.3 and the aerosol model HAM2.3 were updated from previous versions. The updated version of the HAM aerosol model contains improved parameterizations of aerosol processes such as cloud activation, as well as updated emission fields for anthropogenic aerosol species and modifications in the online computation of sea salt and mineral dust aerosol emissions. Aerosol results from nudged and free-running simulations for the 10-year period 2003 to 2012 are compared to various measurements of aerosol properties. While there are regional deviations between the model and observations, the model performs well overall in terms of aerosol optical thickness, but may underestimate coarse-mode aerosol concentrations to some extent so that the modeled particles are smaller than indicated by the observations. Sulfate aerosol measurements in the US and Europe are reproduced well by the model, while carbonaceous aerosol species are biased low. Both mineral dust and sea salt aerosol concentrations are improved compared to previous versions of ECHAM–HAM.

We show that limiting cumulative post-2015 CO2 emissions to about 200 GtC would limit post-2015 warming to less than 0.6 °C in 66\% of Earth system model members of the CMIP5 ensemble with no mitigation of other climate drivers. We combine a simple climate–carbon-cycle model with estimated ranges for key climate system properties from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Assuming emissions peak and decline to below current levels by 2030, and continue thereafter on a much steeper decline, which would be historically unprecedented but consistent with a standard ambitious mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), results in a likely range of peak warming of 1.2–2.0 °C above the mid-nineteenth century. If CO2 emissions are continuously adjusted over time to limit 2100 warming to 1.5 °C, with ambitious non-CO2 mitigation, net future cumulative CO2 emissions are unlikely to prove less than 250 GtC and unlikely greater than 540 GtC. Hence, limiting warming to 1.5 °C is not yet a geophysical impossibility, but is likely to require delivery on strengthened pledges for 2030 followed by challengingly deep and rapid mitigation. Strengthening near-term emissions reductions would hedge against a high climate response or subsequent reduction rates proving economically, technically or politically unfeasible.},

	abstract = {The treatment of uncertainty in climate-change science is dominated by the far-reaching influence of the ‘frequentist’ tradition in statistics, which interprets uncertainty in terms of sampling statistics and emphasizes p-values and statistical significance. This is the normative standard in the journals where most climate-change science is published. Yet a sampling distribution is not always meaningful (there is only one planet Earth). Moreover, scientific statements about climate change are hypotheses, and the frequentist tradition has no way of expressing the uncertainty of a hypothesis. As a result, in climate-change science, there is generally a disconnect between physical reasoning and statistical practice. This paper explores how the frequentist statistical methods used in climate-change science can be embedded within the more general framework of probability theory, which is based on very simple logical principles. In this way, the physical reasoning represented in scientific hypotheses, which underpins climate-change science, can be brought into statistical practice in a transparent and logically rigorous way. The principles are illustrated through three examples of controversial scientific topics: the alleged global warming hiatus, Arctic-midlatitude linkages, and extreme event attribution. These examples show how the principles can be applied, in order to develop better scientific practice. “La théorie des probabilités n’est que le bon sens reduit au calcul.” (Pierre-Simon Laplace, Essai Philosophiques sur les Probabilités, 1819). “It is sometimes considered a paradox that the answer depends not only on the observations but on the question; it should be a platitude.” (Harold Jeffreys, Theory of Probability, 1st edition, 1939).},

	abstract = {The precipitation efficiency of convection (ε) plays an important role in simple models of the tropical atmosphere as well as in global climate models' projections of future climate changes, but remains poorly understood and poorly constrained. A particularly urgent question is how ε will change in warmer climates. To address these issues, this study investigates the precipitation efficiency in simulations of radiative‐convective equilibrium with a cloud‐resolving model forced by a wide range of sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Two different domains are considered: a small, doubly periodic domain, and a 2‐D (x‐z) “mock‐Walker” domain with a sinusoidal SST profile that resembles the equatorial Pacific, and the sensitivities of the results to the microphysical scheme and to the horizontal resolution are also explored. It is found that ε generally increases with warming in the small domain simulations because of increases in the efficiency with which cloud condensate is converted into precipitation, with changes in the re‐evaporation of falling precipitation playing a secondary role. This picture is complicated in the 2‐D simulations by substantial changes in the degree of convective organization as the underlying SSTs are varied. ε is found to decrease as convection becomes more organized, because convective organization results in relatively more low clouds, which have small (≤0.1) precipitation efficiencies, and relatively less high clouds, which have larger (∼0.4) precipitation efficiencies. The precipitation efficiency of convection (ε) quantifies the fraction of water that condenses in a cloud that reaches the surface as precipitation. Recent work has shown that changes in ε can play an important role in determining the warming of climate models in response to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and ε is also a key factor in theories for the dynamics of the tropical atmosphere. Despite this importance, however, ε is poorly understood and poorly constrained. In this study, we take a first step to addressing this issue by investigating how precipitation efficiency behaves in idealized simulations of the tropical atmosphere, in which the underlying sea surface temperature is varied across a wide range of values. We find that ε generally increases with warming because clouds become denser and so form precipitation more easily, though in some cases ε decreases because of changes in the large‐scale flow of the tropical atmosphere. Precipitation efficiency is investigated in RCE simulations with a CRM forced by a wide range of SSTs Precipitation efficiency generally increases with warming because of increased cloud density Changes in the large‐scale circulation can cause precipitation efficiency to decrease},

The authors begin by noting several issues with the standard approach for decomposing ECS into a sum of forcing and feedback terms. This leads to a derivation of an alternative method based on linearizing the effect of the net feedback. Consistent with previous studies, the new method identifies shortwave cloud feedback as the dominant source of intermodel spread in ECS. This new approach also reveals that covariances between cloud feedback and forcing, between lapse rate and longwave cloud feedbacks, and between albedo and shortwave cloud feedbacks play an important and previously underappreciated role in determining model differences in ECS. Defining feedbacks based on fixed relative rather than specific humidity (as suggested by Held and Shell) reduces the covariances between processes and leads to more straightforward interpretations of results.},

	abstract = {Aerosols have a potentially large effect on climate, particularly through their interactions with clouds, but the magnitude of this effect is highly uncertain. Large volcanic eruptions produce sulfur dioxide, which in turn produces aerosols; these eruptions thus represent a natural experiment through which to quantify aerosol–cloud interactions. Here we show that the massive 2014–2015 fissure eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, reduced the size of liquid cloud droplets—consistent with expectations—but had no discernible effect on other cloud properties. The reduction in droplet size led to cloud brightening and global-mean radiative forcing of around −0.2 watts per square metre for September to October 2014. Changes in cloud amount or cloud liquid water path, however, were undetectable, indicating that these indirect effects, and cloud systems in general, are well buffered against aerosol changes. This result will reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, because we are now able to reject results from climate models with an excessive liquid-water-path response. Investigations of an Icelandic volcanic eruption confirm that sulfate aerosols caused a discernible yet transient brightening effect, as predicted, but their effect on the liquid water path was unexpectedly negligible. Aerosols cast a wide shadow across many aspects of the Earth system. They reflect solar radiation, increase snow and ice melt, and contribute to local air pollution. Aerosols also interact with clouds, but the net effect of these interactions is difficult to disentangle from coinciding meteorological variations. Sulfate aerosols tend to increase reflection, and theoretical principles state that aerosols should lead to more but smaller cloud particles and should increase cloud lifetime and liquid water path. However, firm confirmation of these indirect effects has been hard to come by. Now, Florent Malavelle et al. use observations and modelling to help to understand the effects of a recent volcanic eruption in Iceland. The sulfate aerosols associated with the eruption caused a discernible yet transient brightening effect, but the effects on liquid water path were negligible. This result will help to reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, because results from climate models with excessive liquid-water-path responses can now be rejected.},

	abstract = {Descriptions are provided of the aerosol classification algorithms and the extinction-to-backscatter ratio (lidar ratio) selection schemes for the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) aerosol products. One year of CALIPSO level 2 version 2 data are analyzed to assess the veracity of the CALIPSO aerosol-type identification algorithm and generate vertically resolved distributions of aerosol types and their respective optical characteristics. To assess the robustness of the algorithm, the interannual variability is analyzed by using a fixed season (June–August) and aerosol type (polluted dust) over two consecutive years (2006 and 2007). The CALIPSO models define six aerosol types: clean continental, clean marine, dust, polluted continental, polluted dust, and smoke, with 532-nm (1064 nm) extinction-to-backscatter ratios Sa of 35 (30), 20 (45), 40 (55), 70 (30), 65 (30), and 70 (40) sr, respectively. This paper presents the global distributions of the CALIPSO aerosol types, the complementary distributions of integrated attenuated backscatter, and the volume depolarization ratio for each type. The aerosol-type distributions are further partitioned according to surface type (land/ocean) and detection resolution (5, 20, and 80 km) for optical and spatial context, because the optically thick layers are found most often at the smallest spatial resolution. Except for clean marine and polluted continental, all the aerosol types are found preferentially at the 80-km resolution. Nearly 80\% of the smoke cases and 60\% of the polluted dust cases are found over water, whereas dust and polluted continental cases are found over both land and water at comparable frequencies. Because the CALIPSO observables do not sufficiently constrain the determination of the aerosol, the surface type is used to augment the selection criteria. Distributions of the total attenuated color ratios show that the use of surface type in the typing algorithm does not result in abrupt and artificial changes in aerosol type or extinction.},

	abstract = {Absorbing aerosols, like black carbon (BC), give rise to rapid adjustments, and the associated perturbation to the atmospheric temperature structure alters the cloud distribution. The level of scientific understanding of these rapid cloud adjustments—otherwise known as semi-direct effects (SDEs)—is considered low, with models indicating a likely negative (−0.44 to +0.1 Wm−2) forcing. Recent studies suggest this negative SDE is primarily driven by decreases in high-level clouds and enhanced longwave cooling. Here, we investigate the SDE using multiple models driven by observationally constrained fine-mode aerosol forcing without dust and sea salt. Unlike aerosol simulations, which yield a relatively vertically uniform aerosol atmospheric heating profile with significant upper-tropospheric heating, observation-based heating peaks in the lower-troposphere and then decays to zero in the mid-troposphere. We find a significant global annual mean decrease in low- and mid-level clouds, and weaker decreases in high-level clouds, which leads to a positive SDE dominated by shortwave radiation. Thus, in contrast to most studies, we find a robust positive SDE, implying cloud adjustments act to warm the climate system. Sensitivity tests with identical average, but vertically uniform observationally constrained aerosol atmospheric heating result in a negative SDE, due to enhanced longwave cooling as a result of large reductions in high-level clouds. Our results therefore suggest that model simulations lead to a negatively biased SDE, due to an aerosol atmospheric heating profile that is too vertically uniform. Observationally-constrained modelling reveals aerosol-cloud semi-direct effects (SDE) are likely positive, contrasting with what was once thought. SDE describe aerosol-related changes in cloud distribution and their corresponding radiative forcing. While previous studies indicate SDE are negative, these estimates are associated with large uncertainty, due, in part, to limitations in aerosol observations, specifically inadequate representation of their vertical variability. Robert Allen from the University of California Riverside, USA, and colleagues therefore constrain three climate models with complete aerosol profiles from CALIOP retrievals. The simulations reveal aerosol-cloud SDE act to warm the climate system — thus representing a positive forcing — in response to an increase in shortwave radiation resulting from reductions in low and mid-level clouds. These results emphasise the importance of correctly representing vertical aerosol profiles when quantifying aerosol–cloud interactions and their subsequent radiative effects.},

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the vertical and horizontal extent of clouds and aerosols in the earth’s atmosphere is critical in assessing the planet’s radiation budget and for advancing human understanding of climate change issues. To retrieve this fundamental information from the elastic backscatter lidar data acquired during the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission, a selective, iterated boundary location (SIBYL) algorithm has been developed and deployed. SIBYL accomplishes its goals by integrating an adaptive context-sensitive profile scanner into an iterated multiresolution spatial averaging scheme. This paper provides an in-depth overview of the architecture and performance of the SIBYL algorithm. It begins with a brief review of the theory of target detection in noise-contaminated signals, and an enumeration of the practical constraints levied on the retrieval scheme by the design of the lidar hardware, the geometry of a space-based remote sensing platform, and the spatial variability of the measurement targets. Detailed descriptions are then provided for both the adaptive threshold algorithm used to detect features of interest within individual lidar profiles and the fully automated multiresolution averaging engine within which this profile scanner functions. The resulting fusion of profile scanner and averaging engine is specifically designed to optimize the trade-offs between the widely varying signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements and the disparate spatial resolutions of the detection targets. Throughout the paper, specific algorithm performance details are illustrated using examples drawn from the existing CALIPSO dataset. Overall performance is established by comparisons to existing layer height distributions obtained by other airborne and space-based lidars.},

	abstract = {How subtropical marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds respond to warming is investigated using large‐eddy simulations (LES) of a wide range of warmer climates, with concentrations elevated by factors 2–16. In LES coupled to a slab ocean with interactive sea surface temperatures (SST), the surface latent heat flux (LHF) is constrained by the surface energy balance and only strengthens modestly under warming. Consequently, the MBL in warmer climates is shallower than in corresponding fixed‐SST LES, in which LHF strengthens excessively and the MBL typically deepens. The inferred shortwave (SW) cloud feedback with a closed energy balance is weakly positive for cumulus clouds. It is more strongly positive for stratocumulus clouds, with a magnitude that increases with warming. Stratocumulus clouds generally break up above to warming, or above a four to eightfold increase in concentrations. This occurs because the MBL mixing driven by cloud‐top longwave (LW) cooling weakens as the LW opacity of the free troposphere increases. The stratocumulus breakup triggers an abrupt and large SST increase and MBL deepening, which cannot occur in fixed‐SST experiments. SW cloud radiative effects generally weaken while the lower‐tropospheric stability increases under warming—the reverse of their empirical relation in the present climate. The MBL is deeper and stratocumulus persists into warmer climates if large‐scale subsidence decreases as the climate warms. The contrasts between experiments with interactive SST and fixed SST highlight the importance of a closed surface energy balance for obtaining realizable responses of MBL clouds to warming. LES coupled to a slab ocean highlight the important role a closed surface energy balance plays in obtaining realizable subtropical cloud responses to global warming Cumulus and stratocumulus cloud regimes consistently exhibit a positive shortwave feedback to warming, with a magnitude that depends, e.g., on large‐scale circulation changes and microphysics Stratocumulus clouds break up in sufficiently warm climates, as a result of reduced longwave cooling at the cloud top},

	abstract = {Abstract The effects of anthropogenic aerosol, solid or liquid particles suspended in the air, are the biggest contributor to uncertainty in current climate perturbations. Heavy industry sites, such as coal power plants and steel manufacturers, large sources of greenhouse gases, also emit large amounts of aerosol in a small area. This makes them ideal places to study aerosol interactions with radiation and clouds. However, existing data sets of heavy industry locations are either not public, or suffer from reporting gaps. Here, we develop a supervised deep learning algorithm to detect unreported industry sites in high-resolution satellite data, using the existing data sets for training. For the pipeline to be viable at global scale, we employ a two-step approach. The first step uses 10 m resolution data, which is scanned for potential industry sites, before using 1.2 m resolution images to confirm or reject detections. On held-out test data, the models perform well, with the lower resolution one reaching up to 94\% accuracy. Deployed to a large test region, the first stage model yields many false positive detections. The second stage, higher resolution model shows promising results at filtering these out, while keeping the true positives, improving the precision to 42\% overall, so that human review becomes feasible. In the deployment area, we find five new heavy industry sites which were not in the training data. This demonstrates that the approach can be used to complement existing data sets of heavy industry sites.},

	abstract = {Complex distributions of aerosol properties evolve in space and time as a function of emissions, new particle formation, coagulation, condensational growth, chemical transformation, phase changes, turbulent mixing and transport, removal processes, and ambient meteorological conditions. The ability of chemical transport models to represent the multi-scale processes affecting the life cycle of aerosols depends on their spatial resolution since aerosol properties are assumed to be constant within a grid cell. Subgrid-scale-dependent processes that affect aerosol populations could have a significant impact on the formation of particles, their growth to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) sizes, aerosol–cloud interactions, dry deposition and rainout and hence their burdens, lifetimes, and radiative forcing. To address this issue, we characterize subgrid-scale variability in terms of measured aerosol number, size, composition, hygroscopicity, and CCN concentrations made by repeated aircraft flight paths over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program's Southern Great Plains (SGP) site during the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols and Land Ecosystem (HI-SCALE) campaign. Subgrid variability is quantified in terms of both normalized frequency distributions and percentage difference percentiles using grid spacings of 3, 9, 27, and 81 km that represent those typically used by cloud-system-resolving models as well as the current and next-generation climate models. Even though the SGP site is a rural location, surprisingly large horizontal gradients in aerosol properties were frequently observed. For example, 90 \% of the 3, 9, and 27 km cell mean organic matter concentrations differed from the 81 km cell around the SGP site by as much as ∼ 46 \%, large spatial variability in aerosol number concentrations and size distributions were found during new particle formation events, and consequently 90 \% of the 3, 9, and 27 km cell mean CCN number concentrations differed from the 81 km cell mean by as much as ∼ 38 \%. The spatial variability varied seasonally for some aerosol properties, with some having larger spatial variability during the spring and others having larger variability during the late summer. While measurements at a single surface site cannot reflect the surrounding variability of aerosol properties at a given time, aircraft measurements that are averaged within an 81 km cell were found to be similar to many, but not all, aerosol properties measured at the ground SGP site. This analysis suggests that it is reasonable to directly compare most ground SGP site aerosol measurements with coarse global climate model predictions. In addition, the variability quantified by the aircraft can be used as an uncertainty range when comparing the surface point measurements with model predictions that use coarse grid spacings.},

There are a variety of issues that complicate the analysis of radiative feedbacks in global climate models, resulting in some confusion regarding their strengths and distributions. In this paper, the authors present a method for quantifying climate feedbacks based on “radiative kernels” that describe the differential response of the top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes to incremental changes in the feedback variables. The use of radiative kernels enables one to decompose the feedback into one factor that depends on the radiative transfer algorithm and the unperturbed climate state and a second factor that arises from the climate response of the feedback variables. Such decomposition facilitates an understanding of the spatial characteristics of the feedbacks and the causes of intermodel differences. This technique provides a simple and accurate way to compare feedbacks across different models using a consistent methodology. Cloud feedbacks cannot be evaluated directly from a cloud radiative kernel because of strong nonlinearities, but they can be estimated from the change in cloud forcing and the difference between the full-sky and clear-sky kernels. The authors construct maps to illustrate the regional structure of the feedbacks and compare results obtained using three different model kernels to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology. The results confirm that models typically generate globally averaged cloud feedbacks that are substantially positive or near neutral, unlike the change in cloud forcing itself, which is as often negative as positive.},

Their westward transport over the remote southeast Atlantic Ocean co-locates some of the largest atmospheric loadings of absorbing aerosol with the least examined of the Earth’s major subtropical stratocumulus decks. Global aerosol model results highlight that the largest positive top-of-atmosphere (TOA) forcing in the world occurs in the southeast Atlantic, but this region exhibits large differences in magnitude and sign between reputable models, in part because of high variability in the underlying model cloud distributions. Many uncertainties contribute to the highly variable model radiation fields: the aging of the shortwave-absorbing aerosol during transport, how much of the aerosol mixes into the cloudy boundary layer, and how the low clouds adjust to smoke-radiation and smoke-cloud interactions. In addition, the ability of the biomass burning aerosol to absorb shortwave radiation is known to vary seasonally as the fuel type on land changes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater} LASIC (Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds) is a strategy to improve our understanding of aged carbonaceous aerosol, its seasonal evolution, and the mechanisms by which clouds adjust to the presence of the aerosol.

The measurements span June 1, 2016-October 31, 2017, encompassing two July-October biomass burning seasons. The August-September, 2016, months include an intensive operational period (IOP) with 8x/daily radiosondes. In 2017, from 16 August through 7 September, the United Kingdom Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 plane was deployed from Ascension, providing complementary data on the atmosphere’s vertical structure as part of the Cloud-Aerosol-Radiation Interactions and Forcing (CLARIFY) project, with similar scientific goals. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Observations of Clouds above Aerosols and their Interactions (ORACLES) aircraft campaign, sharing similar objectives to LASIC, deployed from Namibia in September, 2016, and Sao Tome in August, 2017. The latter included a suitcase flight to Ascension spanning August 18-21. In 2017 a cavity-attenuated phase shift single-scattering albedo (CAPS-SSA) instrument belonging to Aerodyne was brought to Ascension, gathering data primarily for August, towards providing a second, independent measurement of aerosol absorption.

	abstract = {Changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions have strongly contributed to global and regional trends in temperature, precipitation, and other climate characteristics and have been one of the dominant drivers of decadal trends in Asian and African precipitation. These and other influences on regional climate from changes in aerosol emissions are expected to continue and potentially strengthen in the coming decades. However, a combination of large uncertainties in emission pathways, radiative forcing, and the dynamical response to forcing makes anthropogenic aerosol a key factor in the spread of near-term climate projections, particularly on regional scales, and therefore an important one to constrain. For example, in terms of future emission pathways, the uncertainty in future global aerosol and precursor gas emissions by 2050 is as large as the total increase in emissions since 1850. In terms of aerosol effective radiative forcing, which remains the largest source of uncertainty in future climate change projections, CMIP6 models span a factor of 5, from -0.3 to -1.5 W m-2. Both of these sources of uncertainty are exacerbated on regional scales. The Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (RAMIP) will deliver experiments designed to quantify the role of regional aerosol emissions changes in near-term projections. This is unlike any prior MIP, where the focus has been on changes in global emissions and/or very idealised aerosol experiments. Perturbing regional emissions makes RAMIP novel from a scientific standpoint and links the intended analyses more directly to mitigation and adaptation policy issues. From a science perspective, there is limited information on how realistic regional aerosol emissions impact local as well as remote climate conditions. Here, RAMIP will enable an evaluation of the full range of potential influences of realistic and regionally varied aerosol emission changes on near-future climate. From the policy perspective, RAMIP addresses the burning question of how local and remote decisions affecting emissions of aerosols influence climate change in any given region. Here, RAMIP will provide the information needed to make direct links between regional climate policies and regional climate change. RAMIP experiments are designed to explore sensitivities to aerosol type and location and provide improved constraints on uncertainties driven by aerosol radiative forcing and the dynamical response to aerosol changes. The core experiments will assess the effects of differences in future global and regional (Africa and the Middle East, East Asia, North America and Europe, and South Asia) aerosol emission trajectories through 2051, while optional experiments will test the nonlinear effects of varying emission locations and aerosol types along this future trajectory. All experiments are based on the shared socioeconomic pathways and are intended to be performed with 6th Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) generation models, initialised from the CMIP6 historical experiments, to facilitate comparisons with existing projections. Requested outputs will enable the analysis of the role of aerosol in near-future changes in, for example, temperature and precipitation means and extremes, storms, and air quality.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of the climate to CO2 forcing depends on spatially-varying radiative feedbacks which act both locally and nonlocally. We assess whether a method employing multiple regression can be used to estimate local and nonlocal radiative feedbacks from internal variability. We test this method on millennial-length simulations performed with six coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Given the spatial pattern of warming, the method does quite well at recreating the top-of-atmosphere flux response for most regions of the Earth, except over the Southern Ocean where it consistently overestimates the change, leading to an overestimate of the sensitivity. For five of the six models, the method finds that local feedbacks are positive due to cloud processes, balanced by negative nonlocal shortwave cloud feedbacks associated with regions of tropical convection. For four of these models, the magnitude of both are comparable to the Planck feedback, so that changes in the ratio between them could lead to large changes in climate sensitivity. The positive local feedback explains why observational studies that estimate spatial feedbacks using only local regressions predict an unstable climate. The method implies that sensitivity in these AOGCMs increases over time due to a reduction in the share of warming occurring in tropical convecting regions and the resulting weakening of associated shortwave cloud and longwave clear-sky feedbacks. Our results provide a step towards an observational estimate of time-varying climate sensitivity by demonstrating that many aspects of spatial feedbacks appear to be the same between internal variability and the forced response.},

The sheer breadth and diversity of different deep learning techniques makes it difficult to determine what scientific problems might be most amenable to these methods, or which specific combination of methods might offer the most promising first approach. In this survey, we focus on addressing this central issue, providing an overview of many widely used deep learning models, spanning visual, sequential and graph structured data, associated tasks and different training methods, along with techniques to use deep learning with less data and better interpret these complex models --- two central considerations for many scientific use cases. We also include overviews of the full design process, implementation tips, and links to a plethora of tutorials, research summaries and open-sourced deep learning pipelines and pretrained models, developed by the community.

	abstract = {Despite the increasing sophistication of climate models, the amount of surface warming expected from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 (equilibrium climate sensitivity) remains stubbornly uncertain, in part because of differences in how models simulate the change in global albedo due to clouds (the shortwave cloud feedback). Here, model differences in the shortwave cloud feedback are found to be closely related to the spatial pattern of the cloud contribution to albedo (α) in simulations of the current climate: high-feedback models exhibit lower (higher) α in regions of warm (cool) sea-surface temperatures, and therefore predict a larger reduction in global-mean α as temperatures rise and warm regions expand. The spatial pattern of α is found to be strongly predictive (r=0.84) of a model’s global cloud feedback, with satellite observations indicating a most-likely value of 0.58±0.31 Wm-2 K-1 (90\% confidence). This estimate is higher than the model-average cloud feedback of 0.43 Wm-2 K-1, with half the range of uncertainty. The observational constraint on climate sensitivity is weaker but still significant, suggesting a likely value of 3.68 ± 1.30 K (90\% confidence), which also favors the upper range of model estimates. These results suggest that uncertainty in model estimates of the global cloud feedback may be substantially reduced by ensuring a realistic distribution of clouds between regions of warm and cool SSTs in simulations of the current climate.},

The underlying causes of this uncertainty among modeled predictions of climate are the gaps in our fundamental understanding of cloud processes. There has been significant progress with both observations and models in addressing these important questions but quantifying them correctly is nontrivial, thus limiting our ability to represent them in global climate models. The Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment (E-PEACE) 2011 was a targeted aircraft campaign with embedded modeling studies, using the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter aircraft and the research vessel Point Sur in July and August 2011 off the central coast of California, with a full payload of instruments to measure particle and cloud number, mass, composition, and water uptake distributions. EPEACE used three emitted particle sources to separate particle-induced feedbacks from dynamical variability, namely 1) shipboard smoke-generated particles with 0.05–1-μm diameters (which produced tracks measured by satellite and had drop composition characteristic of organic smoke), 2) combustion particles from container ships with 0.05–0.2-μm diameters (which were measured in a variety of conditions with droplets containing both organic and sulfate components), and 3) aircraft-based milled salt particles with 3–5-μm diameters (which showed enhanced drizzle rates in some clouds). The aircraft observations were consistent with past large-eddy simulations of deeper clouds in ship tracks and aerosol– cloud parcel modeling of cloud drop number and composition, providing quantitative constraints on aerosol effects on warm-cloud microphysics.},

In the absence of balance constraints, various combinations of modern flux datasets reveal that current estimates of net radiation into Earth’s surface exceed corresponding turbulent heat fluxes by 13–24 W m−2. The largest imbalances occur over oceanic regions where the component algorithms operate independent of closure constraints. Recent uncertainty assessments suggest that these imbalances fall within anticipated error bounds for each dataset, but the systematic nature of required adjustments across different regions confirm the existence of biases in the component fluxes. To reintroduce energy and water cycle closure information lost in the development of independent flux datasets, a variational method is introduced that explicitly accounts for the relative accuracies in all component fluxes. Applying the technique to a 10-yr record of satellite observations yields new energy budget estimates that simultaneously satisfy all energy and water cycle balance constraints. Globally, 180 W m−2 of atmospheric longwave cooling is balanced by 74 W m−2 of shortwave absorption and 106 W m−2 of latent and sensible heat release. At the surface, 106 W m−2 of downwelling radiation is balanced by turbulent heat transfer to within a residual heat flux into the oceans of 0.45 W m−2, consistent with recent observations of changes in ocean heat content. Annual mean energy budgets and their seasonal cycles for each of seven continents and nine ocean basins are also presented.},

Although both the modeled winds from MACC and the measurements from the DWL show a generally good agreement, some differences, particularly in the African easterly jet (AEJ) intensity, were noted. The observed differences between modeled and measured wind jet speeds are between 5 and 10 m s−1. The vertical aerosol distribution within the Saharan dust plume and the marine boundary layer is investigated during the June–July 2013 period based on the MACC aerosol model results and the CALIOP satellite lidar measurements. While the modeled Saharan dust plume extent shows a good agreement with the measurements, a systematic underestimation of the marine boundary layer extinction is observed. Additionally, three selected case studies covering different aspects of the Saharan dust long-range transport along the west African coast, over the North Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean are presented. For the first time, DWL measurements are used to investigate the Saharan dust long-range transport. Simultaneous wind and backscatter measurements from the DWL are used, in combination with the MACC model, to analyze different features associated with the long-range transport, including an African easterly wave trough, the AEJ and the intertropical convergence zone.},

The data is modeled as the output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that Gaussian process are then governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM). We perform inference in the model by approximate variational marginalization. This results in a strict lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the model which we use for model selection (number of layers and nodes per layer). Deep belief networks are typically applied to relatively large data sets using stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Our fully Bayesian treatment allows for the application of deep models even when data is scarce. Model selection by our variational bound shows that a five layer hierarchy is justified even when modelling a digit data set containing only 150 examples.},

Efforts to narrow this distribution by weighting projections according to measures of model fidelity have so far failed, largely because climate sensitivity is independent of current measures of skill in current ensembles of models. This work presents a cautionary example showing that measures of model fidelity that are effective at narrowing the distribution of future projections (because they are systematically related to climate sensitivity in an ensemble of models) may be poor measures of the likelihood that a model will provide an accurate estimate of climate sensitivity (and thus degrade distributions of projections if they are used as weights). Furthermore, it appears unlikely that statistical tests alone can identify robust measures of likelihood. The conclusions are drawn from two ensembles: one obtained by perturbing parameters in a single climate model and a second containing the majority of the world’s climate models. The simple ensemble reproduces many aspects of the multimodel ensemble, including the distributions of skill in reproducing the present-day climatology of clouds and radiation, the distribution of climate sensitivity, and the dependence of climate sensitivity on certain cloud regimes. Weighting by error measures targeted on those regimes permits the development of tighter relationships between climate sensitivity and model error and, hence, narrower distributions of climate sensitivity in the simple ensemble. These relationships, however, do not carry into the multimodel ensemble. This suggests that model weighting based on statistical relationships alone is unfounded and perhaps that climate model errors are still large enough that model weighting is not sensible.},

	abstract = {An observationally constrained time series of historical aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) from 1750 to 2019 is developed in this study. We find that the time history of aerosol ERFs diagnosed in CMIP6 models exhibits considerable variation and explore how the time history of aerosol forcing influences the probability distributions of present‐day aerosol forcing and emergent metrics such as climate sensitivity. Using a simple energy balance model, trained on CMIP6 climate models and constrained by observed near‐surface warming and ocean heat uptake, we derive estimates for the historical aerosol forcing. We find 2005–2014 mean aerosol ERF to be −1.1 (−1.8 to −0.5) W m−2 relative to 1750. Assuming recently published historical emissions from fossil fuel and industrial sectors and biomass burning emissions from SSP2‐4.5, aerosol ERF in 2019 is −0.9 (−1.5 to −0.4) W m−2. There is a modest recovery in aerosol forcing (+0.025 W m−2 decade−1) between 1980 and 2014. This analysis also gives a 5\%–95\% range of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.8°C –5.1°C (best estimate 3.1°C) with a transient climate response of 1.2°C –2.6°C (best estimate 1.8°C). There are two main human drivers of climate change: (a) Greenhouse gas emissions, which warm the planet; and (b) air pollution (aerosols) that offset some of this warming. Unfortunately, disentangling the effects of historical aerosol cooling is difficult based on the available observations. Therefore, we often use climate models to estimate how much aerosols have cooled the Earth since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Over the mid‐to‐late 20th Century, some climate models simulate less warming compared to 1850 than has been observed. This may be because aerosol cooling in some climate models is too strong. Our approach combines the relationships between aerosol emissions and their cooling effects on temperature from 11 climate models with simpler representations of the underlying physics. This simpler mathematical framework allows us to more fully account for uncertainty in both aerosol cooling and its effects on surface temperature and ocean heat uptake by running a much larger set of simulations. Our results suggest that the effect of aerosol cooling has only unwound slowly since 1980, and that it is difficult to determine how sensitive the climate is from this method. We determine the most plausible time history of aerosol forcing that matches surface temperature and Earth energy uptake constraints Constrained aerosol forcing shows a modest recovery between 1980 and 2014, slower than the rate simulated by many CMIP6 models The best estimate aerosol forcing using this method is −1.10 W m−2 for 2005–2014 relative to 1750 We determine the most plausible time history of aerosol forcing that matches surface temperature and Earth energy uptake constraints Constrained aerosol forcing shows a modest recovery between 1980 and 2014, slower than the rate simulated by many CMIP6 models The best estimate aerosol forcing using this method is −1.10 W m−2 for 2005–2014 relative to 1750},

	abstract = {Quantifying effective radiative forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions (E) remains a largely uncertain process, and the magnitude remains unconstrained in general circulation models. Previous studies focus on the magnitude of arising from all cloud types, or examine it in the framework of dynamical regimes. Aerosol forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions in the HadGEM3‐GA7.1 global climate model is decomposed into several global observational cloud regimes. Regimes are assigned to model gridboxes and forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions is calculated on a regime‐by‐regime basis with a 20‐year averaging period. Patterns of regime occurrence are in good agreement with satellite observations. ERFACI is then further decomposed into three terms, representing radiative changes within a given regime, transitions between different cloud regimes, and nonlinear effects. The total global mean ERFACI is Wm−2. When decomposed, simulated ERFACI is greatest in the thick stratocumulus regime (−0.51 Wm−2). The effect of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on clouds is highly uncertain in climate models. Many previous attempts to reduce this uncertainty have focused on examining all cloud types as a whole. This work sets out a framework to examine one measure of aerosol‐cloud interactions when the effect is split by different cloud types. This framework is applied to the HadGEM3‐GA7.1 climate model. It is found that thick stratocumulus clouds exhibit the strongest aerosol‐cloud interactions, especially those found off the west coast of both North and South America, and West Africa. It is hoped that this will lead to a greater understanding of how these interactions manifest themselves in different cloud types, and that this methodology will promote the use of constraints on specific cloud types, to provide potentially greater reductions in the aforementioned uncertainty. The majority of effective radiative forcing in HadGEM3‐GA7.1 comes from stratocumulus clouds Forcing from marine stratocumulus clouds is highly sensitive to aerosol perturbations Decomposing radiative forcing by cloud regimes can be a useful technique to gain insights into climate model predictions The majority of effective radiative forcing in HadGEM3‐GA7.1 comes from stratocumulus clouds Forcing from marine stratocumulus clouds is highly sensitive to aerosol perturbations Decomposing radiative forcing by cloud regimes can be a useful technique to gain insights into climate model predictions},

Using targeted sensitivity experiments with the CESM2 in which prescribed BB emissions are homogenized and variability is removed, we show that the warming is specifically attributable to BB variability from 40° to 70°N and arises from a net thinning of the cloud field and an associated increase in absorbed solar radiation. Our results also demonstrate the potential pitfalls of introducing discontinuities in climate forcing data sets when trying to incorporate novel observations. A discontinuity in the variability of prescribed biomass burning emissions between the satellite era of wildfire monitoring (1997–2014) and both the preceding historical and future time periods is found to drive spurious warming in the Community Earth System Model version 2. The warming arises from a net thinning of the cloud field and an associated increase in absorbed solar radiation during periods of high variability in emissions. Evidence suggestive of similar effects in other climate models is also presented. The results highlight the challenges in evaluating models with observations, even in the modern satellite era. CMIP6‐prescribed biomass burning emissions contain elevated interannual variance from 1997 to 2014 relative to other periods In CESM2, the variability in emissions drives substantial warming in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics Changes in radiation and clouds arising from nonlinear interactions with aerosols underpin the simulated warming CMIP6‐prescribed biomass burning emissions contain elevated interannual variance from 1997 to 2014 relative to other periods In CESM2, the variability in emissions drives substantial warming in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics Changes in radiation and clouds arising from nonlinear interactions with aerosols underpin the simulated warming},

Results indicate very similar performance to other commonly used mesoscale schemes in an offline driver for idealized warm rain cases, better than the previous version of the global model microphysics scheme with diagnostic precipitation. In the mixed phase regime, there is significantly more water and less ice, which may address a common bias seen with the scheme in climate simulations in the Arctic. For steady forcing cases, the scheme has limited sensitivity to time step out to the {\textasciitilde}15-min time steps typical of global models. The scheme is similar to other schemes with moderate sensitivity to vertical resolution. The limited time step sensitivity bodes well for use of the scheme in multiscale models from the mesoscale to the large scale. The scheme is sensitive to idealized perturbations of cloud drop and crystal number. Precipitation decreases and condensate increases with increasing drop number, indicating substantial decreases in precipitation efficiency. The sensitivity is less than with the previous version of the scheme for low drop number concentrations (Nc {\textless} 100 cm−3). Ice condensate increases with ice number, with large decreases in liquid condensate as well for a mixed phase case. As expected with prognostic precipitation, accretion is stronger than with diagnostic precipitation and the accretion to autoconversion ratio increases faster with liquid water path (LWP), in better agreement with idealized models and earlier studies than the previous version.},

Following previous work, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the year of a given map of annual‐mean temperature (or precipitation) from forced climate model simulations. This prediction task requires the ANN to learn forced patterns of change amidst a background of climate noise and model differences. We then apply a neural network visualization technique (layerwise relevance propagation) to visualize the spatial patterns that lead the ANN to successfully predict the year. These spatial patterns thus serve as “reliable indicators” of the forced change. The architecture of the ANN is chosen such that these indicators vary in time, thus capturing the evolving nature of regional signals of change. Results are compared to those of more standard approaches like signal‐to‐noise ratios and multilinear regression in order to gain intuition about the reliable indicators identified by the ANN. We then apply an additional visualization tool (backward optimization) to highlight where disagreements in simulated and observed patterns of change are most important for the prediction of the year. This work demonstrates that ANNs and their visualization tools make a powerful pair for extracting climate patterns of forced change. We demonstrate that machine learning methods, specifically artificial neural networks and their visualization tools, can be used to visualize indicators of change in surface temperature and precipitation within climate models and the observations. Furthermore, we show how neural network visualization tools can assist scientists in comparing results across climate models, as well as between climate models and observations. This work demonstrates that ANNs and their visualization tools make a powerful pair for extracting climate patterns of forced change.

The observed summertime drying over India is replaced by widespread wettening once local aerosol emissions are kept at preindustrial levels while all the other forcings evolve. Constant remote aerosol emissions partially suppress the precipitation decrease. While predominant precipitation changes over India are thus associated with local aerosols, remote aerosols contribute as well, especially in favoring an earlier monsoon onset in June and enhancing summertime rainfall over the northwestern regions. Conversely, temperature and near-surface circulation changes over South Asia are more effectively driven by remote aerosols. These changes are reflected into northward cross-equatorial anomalies in the atmospheric energy transport induced by both local and, to a greater extent, remote aerosols.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions and land use changes have modified atmospheric aerosol concentrations and size distributions over time. Understanding preindustrial conditions and changes in organic aerosol due to anthropogenic activities is important because these features (1) influence estimates of aerosol radiative forcing and (2) can confound estimates of the historical response of climate to increases in greenhouse gases. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), formed in the atmosphere by oxidation of organic gases, represents a major fraction of global submicron‐sized atmospheric organic aerosol. Over the past decade, significant advances in understanding SOA properties and formation mechanisms have occurred through measurements, yet current climate models typically do not comprehensively include all important processes. This review summarizes some of the important developments during the past decade in understanding SOA formation. We highlight the importance of some processes that influence the growth of SOA particles to sizes relevant for clouds and radiative forcing, including formation of extremely low volatility organics in the gas phase, acid‐catalyzed multiphase chemistry of isoprene epoxydiols, particle‐phase oligomerization, and physical properties such as volatility and viscosity. Several SOA processes highlighted in this review are complex and interdependent and have nonlinear effects on the properties, formation, and evolution of SOA. Current global models neglect this complexity and nonlinearity and thus are less likely to accurately predict the climate forcing of SOA and project future climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases. Efforts are also needed to rank the most influential processes and nonlinear process‐related interactions, so that these processes can be accurately represented in atmospheric chemistry‐climate models. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), formed in the atmosphere by oxidation of organic gases, often represents a major fraction of global submicron‐sized atmospheric organic aerosol. Myriad processes affect SOA formation, several of which relate to interactions between natural biogenic emissions and predominantly anthropogenic species such as SO2, NOx, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Many of these key processes are nonlinear and can be synergistic or act to compensate each other in terms of climate forcing. Current atmospheric chemistry‐climate models mostly do not treat these processes. We highlight a number of process‐level mechanisms related to the interactions between anthropogenic and biogenic SOA precursors, for which the corresponding impacts on the radiative effects of SOA need to be investigated in atmospheric chemistry‐climate models. Ultimately, climate models need to capture enough important features of the chemical and dynamic evolution of SOA, in terms of both aerosol number and aerosol mass, as a function of atmospheric variables and anthropogenic perturbations to reasonably predict the spatial and temporal distributions of SOA. A better understanding of SOA formation mechanisms and physical properties is needed to improve estimates of the extent to which anthropogenic emissions and land use changes have modified global aerosol concentrations and size distributions since preindustrial times. We review some important developments in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) that could impact aerosol radiative forcing and response of climate to greenhouse gases We highlight some of the important processes that involve interactions between natural biogenic emissions and anthropogenic emissions We discuss fundamental SOA properties volatility and viscosity and their relation to evolution of aerosol mass and number concentrations in the atmosphere},

Here we use instrumental measurements of historical global mean surface temperature change and Earth’s total heat uptake, alongside estimates of the Earth’s radiative response, to provide a top-down energy budget constraint on historical (1861–1880 to near-present) effective radiative forcing of 2.3 W m−2 (1.7–3.0W m−2; 5–95\% confidence interval). This represents a near 40\% reduction in the 5–95\% uncertainty range assessed by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report2. Although precise estimates of effective radiative forcing in models do not widely exist, our results suggest that the effective radiative forcing may be too small in as many as one-third of climate models in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Improving model representation of radiative forcing should be a priority for modelling centres. This will reduce uncertainties in climate projections that have persisted for decades4,5. Earth’s energy imbalance from human and natural drivers—effective radiative forcing—is difficult to constrain, contributing to uncertainty in long-term climate change. A top-down observational constraint reduces IPCC AR5 assessed uncertainty by nearly 40\% and suggests models are biased low.},

We call this merger simulation intelligence (SI), for short. We argue the motifs of simulation intelligence are interconnected and interdependent, much like the components within the layers of an operating system. Using this metaphor, we explore the nature of each layer of the simulation intelligence operating system stack (SI-stack) and the motifs therein: (1) Multi-physics and multi-scale modeling; (2) Surrogate modeling and emulation; (3) Simulation-based inference; (4) Causal modeling and inference; (5) Agent-based modeling; (6) Probabilistic programming; (7) Differentiable programming; (8) Open-ended optimization; (9) Machine programming. We believe coordinated efforts between motifs offers immense opportunity to accelerate scientific discovery, from solving inverse problems in synthetic biology and climate science, to directing nuclear energy experiments and predicting emergent behavior in socioeconomic settings. We elaborate on each layer of the SI-stack, detailing the state-of-art methods, presenting examples to highlight challenges and opportunities, and advocating for specific ways to advance the motifs and the synergies from their combinations.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols are hypothesized to enhance planetary albedo and offset some of the warming due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. Aerosols can enhance the coverage, reflectance, and lifetime of warm low-level clouds. However, the relationship between cloud lifetime and aerosol concentration has been challenging to measure from polar orbiting satellites. We estimate two timescales relating to the formation and persistence of low-level clouds over 1○×1○ spatial domains using multiple years of geostationary satellite observations provided by the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Synoptic (SYN) product. Lagrangian trajectories spanning several days along the classic stratus-to-cumulus transition zone are stratified by aerosol optical depth and meteorology. Clouds forming in relatively polluted trajectories tend to have lighter precipitation rates, longer average lifetime, and higher cloud albedo and cloud fraction compared with unpolluted trajectories. While liquid water path differences are found to be negligible, we find direct evidence of increased planetary albedo primarily through increased drop concentration (Nd) and cloud fraction, with the caveat that the aerosol influence on cloud fraction is positive only for stable atmospheric conditions. While the increase in cloud fraction can be large typically in the beginning of trajectories, the Twomey effect accounts for the bulk (roughly 3/4) of the total aerosol indirect radiative forcing estimate.},

The ERA-Interim project was conducted in part to prepare for a new atmospheric reanalysis to replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the early part of the twentieth century. This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields.

We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {Results from the new Department of Energy super‐parameterized (SP) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (SP‐E3SM) are analyzed and compared to the traditionally parameterized E3SMv1 and previous studies using SP models. SP‐E3SM is unique in that it utilizes Graphics Processing Unit hardware acceleration, cloud resolving model mean‐state acceleration, and reduced radiation to dramatically increase the model throughput and allow decadal experiments at 100‐km external resolution. It also differs from other SP models by using a spectral element dynamical core on a cubed‐sphere grid and a finer vertical grid with a higher model top. Despite these differences, SP‐E3SM generally reproduces the behavior of other SP models. Tropical wave variability is improved relative to E3SM, including the emergence of a Madden‐Julian Oscillation and a realistic slowdown of Moist Kelvin Waves. However, the distribution of precipitation exhibits indicates an overly frequent occurrence of rain rates less than 1 mm day , and while the timing of diurnal rainfall shows modest improvements the signal is not as coherent as observations. A notable grid imprinting bias is identified in the precipitation field and attributed to a unique feedback associated with the interactions between the explicit cloud resolving model convection and the spectral element grid structure. Spurious zonal mean column water tendencies due to grid imprinting are quantified—while negligible for the conventionally parameterized E3SM, they become large with super‐parameterization, approaching 10\% of the physical tendencies. The implication is that finding a remedy to grid imprinting will become especially important as spectral element dynamical cores begin to be combined with explicitly resolved convection. SP‐E3SM improves tropical variability like previous super‐parameterized models but shows modest improvements in the diurnal precipitation The spectral element grid leads to an imprinting bias when used with super‐parameterization and has nonnegligible effects on the climate The throughput of SP‐E3SM was increased to roughly 1.2–1.4 simulated years per day through hardware (GPU) and algorithmic acceleration},

	abstract = {Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are large contributors to fine-particle loadings and radiative forcing but are often represented crudely in global models. We have implemented three new detailed SOA treatments within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) that allow us to compare the semivolatile versus nonvolatile SOA treatments (based on some of the latest experimental findings) and to investigate the effects of gas-phase fragmentation reactions. The new treatments also track SOA from biomass burning and biofuel, fossil fuel, and biogenic sources. For semivolatile SOA treatments, fragmentation reactions decrease the simulated annual global SOA burden from 7.5 Tg to 1.8 Tg. For the nonvolatile SOA treatment with fragmentation, the burden is 3.1 Tg. Larger differences between nonvolatile and semivolatile SOA (up to a factor of 5) exist in areas of continental outflow over the oceans. According to comparisons with observations from global surface Aerosol Mass Spectrometer measurements and the U.S. Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network measurements, the FragNVSOA treatment, which treats SOA as nonvolatile and includes gas-phase fragmentation reactions, agrees best at rural locations. Urban SOA is underpredicted, but this may be due to the coarse model resolution. All three revised treatments show much better agreement with aircraft measurements of organic aerosols (OA) over the North American Arctic and sub-Arctic in spring and summer, compared to the standard CAM5 formulation. This is mainly due to the oxidation of SOA precursor gases from biomass burning, not included in standard CAM5, and long-range transport of biomass burning OA at high altitudes. The revised model configurations that include fragmentation (both semivolatile and nonvolatile SOA) show much better agreement with MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometers (MODIS) aerosol optical depth data over regions dominated by biomass burning during the summer compared to standard CAM5, and predict biomass burning and biofuel as the largest global source of OA, followed by biogenic and fossil fuel sources. The large contribution of biomass burning OA in the revised treatments is supported by these measurements, but the emissions and aging of SOA precursors and POA are uncertain, and need further investigation. The nonvolatile and semivolatile configurations with fragmentation predict the direct radiative forcing of SOA as −0.5 W m−2 and −0.26 W m−2 respectively, at top of the atmosphere, which are higher than previously estimated by most models, but in reasonable agreement with a recent constrained modeling study. This study highlights the importance of improving process-level representation of SOA in global models.},

Here, we articulate a framework to assess ECs, and provide indicators whereby a proposed EC may move from a strong statistical relationship to confirmation. The primary indicators are verified mechanisms and out-of-sample testing. Confirmed ECs have the potential to improve ESMs by focusing attention on the variables most relevant to climate projections. Looking forward, there may be undiscovered ECs for extremes and teleconnections, and ECs may help identify climate system tipping points. Emergent constraints can be an evaluation tool for Earth System Models. This Perspective discusses emergent constraints, how they should be assessed, and when these statistical relationships can be confirmed and used to improve understanding of the changing climate system.},

Analyzed 925-hPa winds were used to predict the afternoon positions of ship tracks found in the morning imagery. Droplet effective radii, visible optical depths, and liquid water amounts were analyzed for morning and afternoon clouds that, based on the low-level winds, were taken to be the same clouds. As found in a previous study by Segrin et al., both morning and afternoon polluted clouds had smaller droplet radii, larger optical depths, and smaller liquid water amounts than the nearby unpolluted clouds. In contrast to the Segrin et al. study, however, the droplet effective radii decreased significantly from morning to afternoon in both the polluted and unpolluted clouds, with the rate of decrease being twice as large for the unpolluted clouds. The larger decrease in the unpolluted clouds is thought to be caused by drizzle, which is probably absent in the polluted clouds. The observations suggest that, with their slower rate of liquid loss, polluted clouds could have longer lifetimes than their unpolluted counterparts. Of interest is that clouds with similar droplet radii but smaller optical depths, and thus smaller droplet number concentrations and liquid water amounts, exhibited higher sensitivities to the effects of elevated particle concentrations and a greater likelihood of appearing in both the morning and afternoon satellite overpasses.},

	abstract = {In the last two IPCC assessments aerosol radiative forcings have been given the largest uncertainty range of all forcing agents assessed. This forcing range is really a diversity of simulated forcings in different models. An essential step towards reducing model uncertainty is to quantify and attribute the sources of uncertainty at the process level. Here, we use statistical emulation techniques to quantify uncertainty in simulated concentrations of July-mean cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) from a complex global aerosol microphysics model. CCN was chosen because it is the aerosol property that controls cloud drop concentrations, and therefore the aerosol indirect radiative forcing effect. We use Gaussian process emulation to perform a full variance-based sensitivity analysis and quantify, for each model grid box, the uncertainty in simulated CCN that results from 8 uncertain model parameters. We produce global maps of absolute and relative CCN sensitivities to the 8 model parameter ranges and derive probability density functions for simulated CCN. The approach also allows us to include the uncertainty from interactions between these parameters, which cannot be quantified in traditional one-at-a-time sensitivity tests. The key findings from our analysis are that model CCN in polluted regions and the Southern Ocean are mostly only sensitive to uncertainties in emissions parameters but in all other regions CCN uncertainty is driven almost exclusively by uncertainties in parameters associated with model processes. For example, in marine regions between 30° S and 30° N model CCN uncertainty is driven mainly by parameters associated with cloud-processing of Aitken-sized particles whereas in polar regions uncertainties in scavenging parameters dominate. In these two regions a single parameter dominates but in other regions up to 50\% of the variance can be due to interaction effects between different parameters. Our analysis provides direct quantification of the reduction in variance that would result if a parameter could be specified precisely. When extended to all process parameters the approach presented here will therefore provide a clear global picture of how improved knowledge of aerosol processes would translate into reduced model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity, the global surface temperature response to CO doubling, has been persistently uncertain. Recent consensus places it likely within 1.5–4.5 K. Global climate models (GCMs), which attempt to represent all relevant physical processes, provide the most direct means of estimating climate sensitivity via CO quadrupling experiments. Here we show that the closely related effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), with values spanning 1.8–5.6 K across 27 GCMs and exceeding 4.5 K in 10 of them. This (statistically insignificant) increase is primarily due to stronger positive cloud feedbacks from decreasing extratropical low cloud coverage and albedo. Both of these are tied to the physical representation of clouds which in CMIP6 models lead to weaker responses of extratropical low cloud cover and water content to unforced variations in surface temperature. Establishing the plausibility of these higher sensitivity models is imperative given their implied societal ramifications. The severity of climate change is closely related to how much the Earth warms in response to greenhouse gas increases. Here we find that the temperature response to an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased substantially in the latest generation of global climate models. This is primarily because low cloud water content and coverage decrease more strongly with global warming, causing enhanced planetary absorption of sunlight—an amplifying feedback that ultimately results in more warming. Differences in the physical representation of clouds in models drive this enhanced sensitivity relative to the previous generation of models. It is crucial to establish whether the latest models, which presumably represent the climate system better than their predecessors, are also providing a more realistic picture of future climate warming. Climate sensitivity is larger on average in CMIP6 than in CMIP5 due mostly to a stronger positive low cloud feedback This is due to greater reductions in low cloud cover and weaker increases in low cloud water content, primarily in the extratropics These changes are related to model physics differences that are apparent in unforced climate variability},

	abstract = {There is an increasing need to consistently combine observations from different sensors to monitor the state of the land surface. In order to achieve this, robust methods based on the inversion of radiative transfer (RT) models can be used to interpret the satellite observations. This typically results in an inverse problem, but a major drawback of these methods is the computational complexity. We introduce the concept of Gaussian Process (GP) emulators: surrogate functions that accurately approximate RT models using a small set of input (e.g., leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll, etc.) and output (e.g., top-of-canopy reflectances or at sensor radiances) pairs. The emulators quantify the uncertainty of their approximation, and provide a fast and easy route to estimating the Jacobian of the original model, enabling the use of e.g., efficient gradient descent methods. We demonstrate the emulation of widely used RT models (PROSAIL and SEMIDISCRETE) and the coupling of vegetation and atmospheric (6S) RT models targetting particular sensor bands. A comparison with the full original model outputs shows that the emulators are a viable option to replace the original model, with negligible bias and discrepancies which are much smaller than the typical uncertainty in the observations. We also extend the theory of GP to cope with models with multivariate outputs (e.g., over the full solar reflective domain), and apply this to the emulation of PROSAIL, coupled 6S and PROSAIL and to the emulation of individual spectral components of 6S. In all cases, emulators successfully predict the full model output as well as accurately predict the gradient of the model calculated by finite differences, and produce speed ups between 10,000 and 50,000 times that of the original model. Finally, we use emulators to invert leaf area index ( L A I ), leaf chlorophyll content ( C a b ) and equivalent leaf water thickness ( C w ) from a time series of observations from Sentinel-2/MSI, Sentinel-3/SLSTR and Proba-V observations. We use sophisticated Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that exploit the speed of the emulators as well as the gradient estimation, a variational data assimilation (DA) method that extends the problem with temporal regularisation, and a particle filter using a regularisation model. The variational and particle filter approach appear more successful (meaning parameters closer to the truth, and smaller uncertainties) than the MCMC approach as a result of using the temporal regularisation mode. These work therefore suggests that GP emulators are a practical way to implement sophisticated parameter retrieval schemes in an era of increasing data volumes.},

	abstract = {Global climate change projections are subject to substantial modelling uncertainties. A variety of emergent constraints, as well as several other statistical model evaluation approaches, have been suggested to address these uncertainties. However, they remain heavily debated in the climate science community. Still, the central idea to relate future model projections to already observable quantities has no real substitute. Here, we highlight the validation perspective of predictive skill in the machine learning community as a promising alternative viewpoint. Specifically, we argue for quantitative approaches in which each suggested constraining relationship can be evaluated comprehensively based on out-of-sample test data – on top of qualitative physical plausibility arguments that are already commonplace in the justification of new emergent constraints. Building on this perspective, we review machine learning ideas for new types of controlling-factor analyses (CFAs). The principal idea behind these CFAs is to use machine learning to find climate-invariant relationships in historical data which hold approximately under strong climate change scenarios. On the basis of existing data archives, these climate-invariant relationships can be validated in perfect-climate-model frameworks. From a machine learning perspective, we argue that such approaches are promising for three reasons: (a) they can be objectively validated for both past data and future data, (b) they provide more direct – and, by design, physically plausible – links between historical observations and potential future climates, and (c) they can take high-dimensional and complex relationships into account in the functions learned to constrain the future response. We demonstrate these advantages for two recently published CFA examples in the form of constraints on climate feedback mechanisms (clouds, stratospheric water vapour) and discuss further challenges and opportunities using the example of a rapid adjustment mechanism (aerosol–cloud interactions). We highlight several avenues for future work, including strategies to address non-linearity, to tackle blind spots in climate model ensembles, to integrate helpful physical priors into Bayesian methods, to leverage physics-informed machine learning, and to enhance robustness through causal discovery and inference.},

	abstract = {This work presents the first step in the development of the VISION toolkit, a set of Python tools that allows easy, efficient, and more meaningful comparison between global atmospheric models and observational data. Whilst observational data and modelling capabilities are expanding in parallel, there are still barriers preventing these two data sources from being used in synergy. This arises from differences in spatial and temporal sampling between models and observational platforms: observational data from a research aircraft, for example, are sampled on specified flight trajectories at very high temporal resolution. Proper comparison with model data requires generating, storing, and handling a large number of highly temporally resolved model files, resulting in a process which is data-, labour-, and time-intensive. In this paper we focus on comparison between model data and in situ observations (from aircraft, ships, buoys, sondes, etc.). A standalone code, In-Situ Observations Simulator, or ISO\_simulator for short, is described here: this software reads modelled variables and observational data files and outputs model data interpolated in space and time to match observations. These model data are then written to NetCDF files that can be efficiently archived due to their small sizes and directly compared to observations. This method achieves a large reduction in the size of model data being produced for comparison with flight and other in situ data. By interpolating global gridded hourly files onto observation locations, we reduce data output for a typical climate resolution run, from ∼3 Gb per model variable per month to ∼15 Mb per model variable per month (a 200-times reduction in data volume). The VISION toolkit is relatively fast to run and can be automated to process large volumes of data at once, allowing efficient data analysis over a large number of years. Although this code was initially tested within the Unified Model (UM) framework, which is shared by the UK Earth System Model (UKESM), it was written as a flexible tool and it can be extended to work with other models.},

	abstract = {We assessed the biomass burning (BB) smoke aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulations of 11 global models that participated in the AeroCom phase III BB emission experiment. By comparing multi-model simulations and satellite observations in the vicinity of fires over 13 regions globally, we (1) assess model-simulated BB AOD performance as an indication of smoke source–strength, (2) identify regions where the common emission dataset used by the models might underestimate or overestimate smoke sources, and (3) assess model diversity and identify underlying causes as much as possible. Using satellite-derived AOD snapshots to constrain source strength works best where BB smoke from active sources dominates background non-BB aerosol, such as in boreal forest regions and over South America and southern hemispheric Africa. The comparison is inconclusive where the total AOD is low, as in many agricultural burning areas, and where the background is high, such as parts of India and China. Many inter-model BB AOD differences can be traced to differences in values for the mass ratio of organic aerosol to organic carbon, the BB aerosol mass extinction efficiency, and the aerosol loss rate from each model. The results point to a need for increased numbers of available BB cases for study in some regions and especially to a need for more extensive regional-to-global-scale measurements of aerosol loss rates and of detailed particle microphysical and optical properties; this would both better constrain models and help distinguish BB from other aerosol types in satellite retrievals. More generally, there is the need for additional efforts at constraining aerosol source strength and other model attributes with multi-platform observations.},

	abstract = {Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions, to map observational time series to latent representations. Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability. Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data. An implementation of SPACY is available at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/SPACY/\}},

While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this issue, models fine-tuned on tool usage become overreliant on them and incur unnecessary costs. Inspired by how human experts assess problem complexity before selecting solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, *Adapting while Learning* (AWL). In the first component *World Knowledge Learning* (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tool-generated solutions. In the second component *Tool Usage Adaptation* (TUA), we categorize problems as easy or hard based on the model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for easy problems while switching to tools for hard ones. We validate our method on 6 scientific benchmark datasets across climate science, epidemiology, physics, and other domains. Compared to the original instruct model (8B), models post-trained with AWL achieve 29.11{\textbackslash}\% higher answer accuracy and 12.72{\textbackslash}\% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on 4 custom-created datasets.

	abstract = {Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling aims to learn an accurate surrogate at the highest fidelity level by combining data from multiple sources. Traditional methods relying on Gaussian processes can hardly scale to high-dimensional data. Deep learning approaches utilize neural network based encoders and decoders to improve scalability. These approaches share encoded representations across fidelities without including corresponding decoder parameters. This hinders inference performance, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios when the highest fidelity data has limited domain coverage. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-fidelity Residual Neural Processes (MFRNP), a novel multi-fidelity surrogate modeling framework. MFRNP explicitly models the residual between the aggregated output from lower fidelities and ground truth at the highest fidelity. The aggregation introduces decoders into the information sharing step and optimizes lower fidelity decoders to accurately capture both in-fidelity and cross-fidelity information. We show that MFRNP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in learning partial differential equations and a real-world climate modeling task.

Traditional approaches often rely on either bottom-up process-based models, difficult to constrain against present-day observations, or top-down methods that lack the ability to capture the underlying processes accurately. Here, we present an approach that combines both bottom-up process-based constraints and top-down energetic constraints of aerosol forcing and cloud feedbacks simultaneously to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of aerosol impacts on clouds and the climate. Applying the new method to the Community Atmosphere Model v6, we infer narrower parameter ranges for key process parameters, a reduced effective radiative forcing of −1.08 [−1.29–−0.77] Wm−2, and hence 66\% more precise future projections.},

AerChemMIP provided the first consistent calculation of effective radiative forcing (ERF) for a wide range of forcing agents, which was a vital contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It supported the quantification of composition–climate feedback parameters and the climate response to short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), as well as enabled the future impacts of air pollution mitigation to be identified, and the study of interactions between climate and air quality in a transient simulations. Here we review AerChemMIP in detail and assess the project against its stated objectives, its contribution to the CMIP6 project, and the wider scientific efforts designed to understand the role of aerosols and chemistry in the Earth system. We assess the successes of the project and the remaining challenges and gaps. We conclude with some recommendations that we hope will provide input to planning for future MIPs in this area. In particular, we highlight the necessity of sufficient ensemble size for the attribution of regional climate responses and the need for coordination across projects to ensure key science questions are addressed.

The analysis is framed on the extreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the Oroville Dam spillway incident in Northern California. “Past” and “future” simulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the preindustrial and the late twenty-first century temperature climate change signals, respectively. The simulations are compared to the results from a dynamical model which represents plausible “pseudorealities” under both climate environments. Overall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5\%–6\% increase in the integrated water vapor over the Oroville Dam in the present day compared to the preindustrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different geopotential–moisture–temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the AI models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the physicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to simulate weaker attribution values than the “pseudoreality” imagined by the dynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for the late twenty-first century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model ({\textgreater}500 members) produced statistically significant present-day to preindustrial attribution results, unlike the {\textgreater}20-member ensemble from the dynamical model. This analysis highlights the potential of AI models to conduct the attribution analysis, while emphasizing future lines of work on explainable artificial intelligence to gain confidence in these tools, which can enable reliable attribution studies in real time. Significance Statement Large volumes of greenhouse gasses are continuously emitted into the air, warming Earth’s atmosphere, and increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts, and heavy precipitation. Climate attribution by means of the storyline approach aims to quantify the human fingerprint in observed extreme events to establish a connection between climate change and the weather we experience. Attribution studies currently rely on dynamical models to simulate the climate system, which require huge computational resources and demand long simulation times, limiting the number of events analyzed and preventing reports to be published in near–real time, where public attention is at its peak. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) data-driven models are examined for this task.},

More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and data sets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We compare these deep learning emulators with a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and show that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally resolved climate variables, notably surface temperature and precipitation. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. Precipitation is a much more noisy variable, and we show that deep learning emulators can overfit to internal variability noise at low frequencies, degrading their performance in comparison to a linear emulator. We address the issue of overfitting by increasing the number of climate simulations per emission pathway (from 3 to 50) and updating the benchmark targets with the respective ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based technique for emulating precipitation.

	abstract = {In 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented strict new regulations on the emissions of sulfate aerosol from the world's shipping fleet. This can be expected to lead to a reduction in aerosol-driven cooling, unmasking a portion of greenhouse gas warming. The magnitude of the effect is uncertain, however, due to the large remaining uncertainties in the climate response to aerosols. Here, we investigate this question using an 18-member ensemble of fully coupled climate simulations evenly sampling key modes of climate variability with the NCAR model, the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). We show that, while there is a clear physical response of the climate system to the IMO regulations, including a surface temperature increase, we do not find global mean temperature influence that is significantly different from zero. The 20-year average global mean warming for 2020–2040 is +0.03 °C, with a 5 \%–95 \% confidence range of [-0.09,0.19], reflecting the weakness of the perturbation relative to internal variability. We do, however, find a robust, non-zero regional temperature response in part of the North Atlantic. We also find that the maximum annual mean and ensemble mean warming occurs around 1 decade after the perturbation in 2029, which means that the IMO regulations have likely had very limited influence on observed global warming to date. We further discuss our results in light of other, recent publications that have reached different conclusions. Overall, while the IMO regulations may contribute up to 0.16 °C [-0.17,0.52] to the global mean surface temperature in individual years during this decade, consistent with some early studies, such a response is unlikely to have been discernible above internal variability by the end of 2023 and is in fact consistent with zero throughout the 2020–2040 period.},

	abstract = {The climate science community aims to improve our understanding of climate change due to anthropogenic influences on atmospheric composition and the Earth's surface. Yet not all climate interactions are fully understood, and uncertainty in climate model results persists, as assessed in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. We synthesize current challenges and emphasize opportunities for advancing our understanding of the interactions between atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate change, as well as for quantifying model diversity. Our perspective is based on expert views from three multi-model intercomparison projects (MIPs) – the Precipitation Driver Response MIP (PDRMIP), the Aerosol Chemistry MIP (AerChemMIP), and the Radiative Forcing MIP (RFMIP). While there are many shared interests and specializations across the MIPs, they have their own scientific foci and specific approaches. The partial overlap between the MIPs proved useful for advancing the understanding of the perturbation–response paradigm through multi-model ensembles of Earth system models of varying complexity. We discuss the challenges of gaining insights from Earth system models that face computational and process representation limits and provide guidance from our lessons learned. Promising ideas to overcome some long-standing challenges in the near future are kilometer-scale experiments to better simulate circulation-dependent processes where it is possible and machine learning approaches where they are needed, e.g., for faster and better subgrid-scale parameterizations and pattern recognition in big data. New model constraints can arise from augmented observational products that leverage multiple datasets with machine learning approaches. Future MIPs can develop smart experiment protocols that strive towards an optimal trade-off between the resolution, complexity, and number of simulations and their length and, thereby, help to advance the understanding of climate change and its impacts.},

Aerosol forcing through aerosol-cloud interactions is mostly negative (a cooling) due to shortwave radiation, while feedbacks are positive or negative in different regions due to contrasting longwave and shortwave effects. Both forcing and feedbacks are related to the mean climate state. Higher magnitude cloud radiative effects generally mean larger magnitude net negative forcing and larger magnitude net positive feedback. Aerosol forcing is broadly related to the susceptibility of clouds to drop number. Feedbacks also related to susceptibility, but to a lesser extent and in different regions to aerosol forcing. Aerosol forcing and cloud feedbacks are anti-correlated in the CAM6 PPE such that stronger negative forcing is associated with stronger positive feedbacks. Even the processes governing forcing and feedback sensitivity in the PPE are similar. These include the warm rain formation process, ice loss processes and deep convective intensity.},

In 2020, new shipping regulations mandated an ∼80\% reduction in the allowed fuel sulfur content. Recent observations indicate that visible ship tracks have decreased. Model simulations indicate that since 2020 shipping regulations have induced a net radiative forcing of +0.12 Wm−2. Analysis of recent temperature anomalies indicates Northern Hemisphere surface temperature anomalies in 2022–2023 are correlated with observed cloud radiative forcing and the cloud radiative forcing is spatially correlated with the simulated radiative forcing from the 2020 shipping emission changes. Shipping emissions changes could be accelerating global warming. To better constrain these estimates, better access to ship position data and understanding of ship aerosol emissions are needed. Understanding the risks and benefits of emissions reductions and the difficultly in robust attribution highlights the large uncertainty in attributing proposed deliberate climate intervention.},

	abstract = {Aerosol-induced absorption of shortwave radiation can modify the climate through local atmospheric heating, which affects lapse rates, precipitation, and cloud formation. Presently, the total amount of aerosol absorption is poorly constrained, and the main absorbing aerosol species (black carbon (BC), organic aerosols (OA), and mineral dust) are diversely quantified in global climate models. As part of the third phase of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) intercomparison initiative (AeroCom phase III), we here document the distribution and magnitude of aerosol absorption in current global aerosol models and quantify the sources of intermodel spread, highlighting the difficulties of attributing absorption to different species. In total, 15 models have provided total present-day absorption at 550 nm (using year 2010 emissions), 11 of which have provided absorption per absorbing species. The multi-model global annual mean total absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) is 0.0054 (0.0020 to 0.0098; 550 nm), with the range given as the minimum and maximum model values. This is 28 \% higher compared to the 0.0042 (0.0021 to 0.0076) multi-model mean in AeroCom phase II (using year 2000 emissions), but the difference is within 1 standard deviation, which, in this study, is 0.0023 (0.0019 in Phase II). Of the summed component AAOD, 60 \% (range 36 \%–84 \%) is estimated to be due to BC, 31 \% (12 \%–49 \%) is due to dust, and 11 \% (0 \%–24 \%) is due to OA; however, the components are not independent in terms of their absorbing efficiency. In models with internal mixtures of absorbing aerosols, a major challenge is the lack of a common and simple method to attribute absorption to the different absorbing species. Therefore, when possible, the models with internally mixed aerosols in the present study have performed simulations using the same method for estimating absorption due to BC, OA, and dust, namely by removing it and comparing runs with and without the absorbing species. We discuss the challenges of attributing absorption to different species; we compare burden, refractive indices, and density; and we contrast models with internal mixing to models with external mixing. The model mean BC mass absorption coefficient (MAC) value is 10.1 (3.1 to 17.7) m2 g−1 (550 nm), and the model mean BC AAOD is 0.0030 (0.0007 to 0.0077). The difference in lifetime (and burden) in the models explains as much of the BC AAOD spread as the difference in BC MAC values. The difference in the spectral dependency between the models is striking. Several models have an absorption Ångstrøm exponent (AAE) close to 1, which likely is too low given current knowledge of spectral aerosol optical properties. Most models do not account for brown carbon and underestimate the spectral dependency for OA.},

	abstract = {For over 6 months, the 2014–2015 effusive eruption at Holuhraun, Iceland, injected considerable amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the lower troposphere with a daily rate of up to one-third of the global emission rate, causing extensive air pollution across Europe. The large injection of SO2, which oxidises to form sulfate aerosol (SO42-), provides a natural experiment offering an ideal opportunity to scrutinise state-of-the-art general circulation models' (GCMs) representation of aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs). Here we present Part 1 of a two-part model inter-comparison using the Holuhraun eruption as a framework to analyse ACIs. We use SO2 retrievals from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument and ground-based measurements of SO2 and SO42- mass concentrations across Europe, in conjunction with a trajectory analysis using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, to assess the spatial and chemical evolution of the volcanic plume as simulated by five GCMs and a chemical transport model (CTM). IASI retrievals of plume altitude and SO2 column load reveal that the volcanic perturbation is largely contained within the lower troposphere. Compared to the satellite observations, the models capture the spatial evolution and vertical variability of the plume reasonably well, although the models often overestimate the plume altitude. HYSPLIT trajectories are used to attribute to Holuhraun emissions 111 instances of elevated sulfurous surface mass concentrations recorded at European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) stations during September and October 2014. Comparisons with the simulated concentrations show that the modelled ratio of SO2 to SO42- during these pollution episodes is often underestimated and overestimated for the young and mature plume, respectively. Models with finer vertical resolutions near the surface are found to better capture these elevated sulfurous ground-level concentrations. Using an exponential function to describe the decay of observed surface mass concentration ratios of SO2 to SO42- with plume age, the in-plume oxidation rate constant is estimated as 0.032 ± 0.002 h−1 (1.30 ± 0.08 d e-folding time), with a near-vent ratio of 25 ± 5 (µg m−3 of SO2 / µg m−3 of SO42-). The majority of the corresponding derived modelled oxidation rate constants are lower than the observed estimate. This suggests that the representation of the oxidation pathway/s in the simulated plumes is too slow. Overall, despite their coarse spatial resolutions, the six models show reasonable skill in capturing the spatial and chemical evolution of the Holuhraun plume. This capable representation of the underlying aerosol perturbation is essential to enable the investigation of the eruption's impact on ACIs in the second part of this study.},

	abstract = {Aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty affects estimates of climate sensitivity and limits model skill in terms of making climate projections. Efforts to improve the representations of physical processes in climate models, including extensive comparisons with observations, have not significantly constrained the range of possible aerosol forcing values. A far stronger constraint, in particular for the lower (most-negative) bound, can be achieved using global mean energy balance arguments based on observed changes in historical temperature. Here, we show that structural deficiencies in a climate model, revealed as inconsistencies among observationally constrained cloud properties in the model, limit the effectiveness of observational constraint of the uncertain physical processes. We sample the uncertainty in 37 model parameters related to aerosols, clouds, and radiation in a perturbed parameter ensemble of the UK Earth System Model and evaluate 1 million model variants (different parameter settings from Gaussian process emulators) against satellite-derived observations over several cloudy regions. Our analysis of a very large set of model variants exposes model internal inconsistencies that would not be apparent in a small set of model simulations, of an order that may be evaluated during model-tuning efforts. Incorporating observations associated with these inconsistencies weakens any forcing constraint because they require a wider range of parameter values to accommodate conflicting information. We show that, by neglecting variables associated with these inconsistencies, it is possible to reduce the parametric uncertainty in global mean aerosol forcing by more than 50 \%, constraining it to a range (around −1.3 to −0.1 W m−2) in close agreement with energy balance constraints. Our estimated aerosol forcing range is the maximum feasible constraint using our structurally imperfect model and the chosen observations. Structural model developments targeted at the identified inconsistencies would enable a larger set of observations to be used for constraint, which would then very likely narrow the uncertainty further and possibly alter the central estimate. Such an approach provides a rigorous pathway to improved model realism and reduced uncertainty that has so far not been achieved through the normal model development approach.},

They are also one of the biggest sources of uncertainty for climate modeling. Many climate models do not include aerosols in sufficient detail due to computational constraints.

This is done in the ECHAM-HAM (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast-Hamburg-Hamburg) global climate aerosol model using the M7 microphysics, but high computational costs make it very expensive to run with finer resolution or for a longer time. We aim to use machine learning to emulate the microphysics model at sufficient accuracy and reduce the computational cost by being fast at inference time. The original M7 model is used to generate data of input–output pairs to train a neural network (NN) on it. We are able to learn the variables’ tendencies achieving an average  score of 77.1\%. We further explore methods to inform and constrain the NN with physical knowledge to reduce mass violation and enforce mass positivity. On a Graphics processing unit (GPU), we achieve a speed-up of up to over 64 times faster when compared to the original model.},

Using time-series modeling or more advanced machine learning techniques, data-driven emulators have emerged as a promising avenue of research, producing spatially resolved climate responses that are visually indistinguishable from state-of-the-art ESMs. Yet, their lack of physical interpretability limits their wider adoption. In this work, we introduce FaIRGP, a data-driven emulator that satisfies the physical temperature response equations of an energy balance model. The result is an emulator that (a) enjoys the flexibility of statistical machine learning models and can learn from data, and (b) has a robust physical grounding with interpretable parameters that can be used to make inference about the climate system. Further, our Bayesian approach allows a principled and mathematically tractable uncertainty quantification. Our model demonstrates skillful emulation of global mean surface temperature and spatial surface temperatures across realistic future scenarios. Its ability to learn from data allows it to outperform EBMs, while its robust physical foundation safeguards against the pitfalls of purely data-driven models. We also illustrate how FaIRGP can be used to obtain estimates of top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing and discuss the benefits of its mathematical tractability for applications such as detection and attribution or precipitation emulation. We hope that this work will contribute to widening the adoption of data-driven methods in climate emulation.},

	abstract = {Neural Weather Models (NWM) are novel data-driven weather forecasting tools based on neural networks, that have recently achieved comparable deterministic forecast skill to current operational approaches using significantly less real-time computational resources. They require short inference times, which can potentially improve the characterization of forecast uncertainty by designing very large ensembles, which is of paramount importance for for example, extreme events, and critical for various socio-economic sectors. Here we propose a novel ensemble design for NWMs spanning two main sources of uncertainty: model uncertainty and initial condition uncertainty. For the model uncertainty, we propose an effective strategy for creating a diverse ensemble of NWMs that captures uncertainty in key model parameters. For the initial condition uncertainty, we explore the “breeding of growing modes” for the first time on NWMs, a technique traditionally used for operational numerical weather predictions to estimate the initial condition uncertainty. The combination of these two types of uncertainty produces an ensemble of NWM-based forecasts that is shown to improve upon benchmark probabilistic NWM and is competitive with the 50-member ensemble of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), in terms of both error and calibration. Results are particularly promising over land for three key variables: total column water vapor, surface wind and surface air temperature. The proposed strategy is scalable, enabling the generation of very large ensembles ( \{\vphantom{\}} {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}100) with potential applications for extreme events.},

	abstract = {Aerosol particles from both natural and anthropogenic sources play a critical role in the Earth's climate by interacting with solar radiation and clouds. Anthropogenic aerosol and precursor emissions have historically exerted a global cooling effect, which has partially offset the warming from concurrent greenhouse gas emissions. Recent reductions and shifts in aerosol and precursor emission patterns may reduce this offset and introduce spatially and temporarily varying climate impacts. Investigating aerosol-climate effects is typically done with computationally expensive Earth System Models, which include complex representations of physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes and their coupled interactions for the entire global climate system. In this study, we develop a machine-learning climate emulator using Gaussian processes, called AeroGP, that can be used to quickly assess, for example, the impact of different policy decisions on future climate mitigation strategies. The emulator is trained on a unique data set from the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), analyzed as an ensemble here for the first time. AeroGP accounts for the joint spatial covariance of the output variables and captures the complex, heterogeneous impacts of aerosols on surface temperature using coregionalization. We believe this is the first time this method has been used to account for the spatial correlation of such climate data. We show that AeroGP retains the spatial complexity of NorESM at a fraction of the computational cost and demonstrate its usefulness to assess the sensitivity of temperature to idealized future aerosol emission scenarios.},

	abstract = {Aerosols significantly influence Earth's radiative balance, yet considerable uncertainty exists in the underpinning mechanisms, particularly those involving clouds. Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are the most uncertain element in anthropogenic radiative forcing, hampering our ability to constrain Earth's climate sensitivity and understand future climate change. The 2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption in Iceland released sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the lower troposphere on a level comparable to continental-scale emissions. The resultant volcanic plume across an often near-pristine region of the northern North Atlantic Ocean presents an ideal opportunistic experiment to explore ACI representation within general circulation models (GCMs). We present Part 2 of a two-part AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models) Phase III inter-model comparison study that utilises satellite remote sensing observations to assess modelled cloud responses to the Holuhraun attributed volcanic aerosol within eight state-of-the-art GCMs during September and October 2014. We isolate the aerosol effect from meteorological variability and find that the GCMs – particularly their multi-model ensemble response – adeptly capture the observed cloud microphysical changes associated with the ACI first indirect effect (i.e. Twomey effect). Meanwhile, a clear divergence exists in the GCM responses of large-scale cloud properties, namely cloud liquid water content, expected from the precipitation suppression mechanism of the ACI second indirect effect (i.e. rapid adjustments). We attribute this to limitations and differences in their autoconversion schemes under high aerosol loading, specifically in sub-grid-variability representations. Finally, our multi-model ensemble estimates that Holuhraun had a global radiative forcing of −0.11 ± 0.04 Wm−2 across September and October 2014.},

	abstract = {Global climate models (GCMs) face uncertainties in estimating Earth's radiative budget due to aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). Accurate particle number size distributions (PNSDs) are crucial for improving ACI representation, requiring precise modelling of aerosol sources and sinks. Using a Lagrangian trajectory framework, we examine how clouds and precipitation influence aerosols during transport, and thereby influence aerosol–cloud relationships in the boreal forest. Two GCMs, the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1) and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0 with the SALSA2.0 aerosol module (ECHAM-SALSA), are complemented with model-derived trajectories and evaluated against in-situ observations, which are accompanied by reanalysis trajectories. Overall aerosol–precipitation trends are similar between GCMs and observations. However, seasonal differences emerge: in summer, UKESM1 exhibits more efficient aerosol removal via precipitation than ECHAM-SALSA and observations, whereas in winter, the opposite is observed. These differences coincide with key variables controlling aerosol activation, such as sub-grid scale updraught velocities and PNSDs. For example, in winter, removal of total aerosol mass in ECHAM-SALSA was stronger than in UKESM1, coinciding with higher activated fractions and larger sub-grid scale updraught velocities in ECHAM-SALSA. For both GCMs, cloud processing along trajectories increased SO4 mass, mainly in the accumulation mode, consistent with observations and model parametrizations. Discrepancies arise more from differences in PNSDs and updraught velocities than from wet removal parametrizations, an example being the underrepresentation of small particles in UKESM1. While our findings are representative of boreal region with predominantly stratiform precipitation, further work is needed to evaluate their applicability to other regions.},
