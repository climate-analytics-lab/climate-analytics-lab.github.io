Over the range of excitation power density where the depth of the S-shape is reduced, we also observe a reduction in the integrated photoluminescence intensity per unit excitation power, i.e., efficiency droop. Hence, the onset of efficiency droop occurs at the same carrier density as the onset of carrier delocalization. We correlate these experimental results with the predictions of a theoretical model of the effects of carrier localization due to local variations in the concentration of the randomly distributed In atoms on the optical properties of InGaN/GaN quantum wells. On the basis of this comparison of theory with experiment we attribute the reduction in the S-shape temperature dependence to the saturation of the available localized states. We propose that this saturation of the localized states is a contributory factor to efficiency droop whereby nonlocalized carriers recombine non-radiatively.},

To date there have been several explanations for this phenomena, although no consensus has emerged as to the controlling mechanism(s). In this paper we report on the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence emission from an InGaN/GaN quantum well structure as a function of excitation level. We have observed a reduction in the S-shape temperature dependence of the peak of the emission spectrum at an excitation level that coincides with the onset of the efficiency droop. We suggest that both the efficiency droop and the reduction in the observed S-shape temperature dependence are caused by saturation of the available localised states within the quantum well.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols are a primary source of uncertainty in future climate projections. Changes to aerosol concentrations modify cloud radiative properties, radiative fluxes, and precipitation from the microphysical to the global scale. Due to computational constraints, we have been unable to explicitly simulate cloud dynamics in global-scale simulations, leaving key processes, such as convective updrafts, parameterized. This has significantly limited our understanding of aerosol impacts on convective clouds and climate. However, new state-of-the-art climate models are capable of representing these scales. In this study, we used the kilometer-scale ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) Earth system model to explore the global-scale rapid response of clouds and precipitation to an idealized distribution of anthropogenic aerosol via aerosol–cloud (ACI) and aerosol–radiation (ARI) interactions. In our simulations over 30 d, we find that the aerosol impacts on clouds and precipitation exhibit strong regional dependence. The impact of ARI and ACI on clouds in isolation shows some consistent behavior, but the magnitude and additive nature of the effects are regionally dependent. Some regions are dominated by either ACI or ARI, whereas others behaved nonlinearly. This suggests that the findings of isolated case studies from regional simulations may not be globally representative; ARI and ACI cannot be considered independently and should both be interactively represented in modeling studies. We also observe pronounced diurnal cycles in the rapid response of cloud microphysical and radiative properties, which suggests that the usefulness of using polar-orbiting satellites to quantify ACI and ARI may be more limited than presently assumed. The simulations highlight some limitations that need to be considered in future studies. Isolating kilometer-scale aerosol responses from internal variability will require longer averaging periods or ensemble simulations. It would also be beneficial to use interactive aerosols and assess the sensitivity of the conclusions to the cloud microphysics scheme.},

Yet, the climatic impact of this evolving spatial pattern of absorbing aerosol has received relatively little attention, in particular its impact on global-mean effective radiative forcing. Here, using model experiments, we show that the effective radiative forcing from absorbing aerosol varies strongly depending on their location, driven by rapid adjustments of clouds and circulation. Our experiments generate positive effective radiative forcing in response to aerosol absorption throughout the midlatitudes and most of the tropical regions, and a strong ‘hot spot’ of negative effective radiative forcing in response to aerosol absorption over the tropical Western Pacific. Further, these diverse responses can be robustly attributed to changes in atmospheric dynamics and highlight the importance of this ‘aerosol pattern effect’ for transient forcing from regional biomass-burning aerosol. Changes in the spatial pattern of aerosol could influence climate through effects on radiative forcing. Model experiments show that while aerosol absorption in the midlatitudes and regions of tropical descent can warm the planet, aerosol absorption in regions of tropical ascent can cool the planet.},

	abstract = {Modern weather and climate models share a common heritage and often even components; however, they are used in different ways to answer fundamentally different questions. As such, attempts to emulate them using machine learning should reflect this. While the use of machine learning to emulate weather forecast models is a relatively new endeavour, there is a rich history of climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is an initial condition problem, which intimately depends on the current state of the atmosphere, climate modelling is predominantly a boundary condition problem. To emulate the response of the climate to different drivers therefore, representation of the full dynamical evolution of the atmosphere is neither necessary, or in many cases, desirable. Climate scientists are typically interested in different questions also. Indeed emulating the steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g. parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the large datasets, non-linear relationships and limited training data make climate a domain which is rich in interesting machine learning challenges. Here, I seek to set out the current state of climate model emulation and demonstrate how, despite some challenges, recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for creating useful statistical models of the climate.

Ship tracks—the visible manifestation of the indirect of effect of ship emissions on clouds as quasi-linear features—have long provided an opportunity to quantify these effects. However, they have been arduous to catalog and typically studied only in particular regions for short periods of time. Using a machine-learning algorithm to automate their detection we catalog more than 1 million ship tracks to provide a global climatology. We use this to investigate the effect of stringent fuel regulations introduced by the International Maritime Organization in 2020 on their global prevalence since then, while accounting for the disruption in global commerce caused by COVID-19. We find a marked, but clearly nonlinear, decline in ship tracks globally: An 80\% reduction in SO x emissions causes only a 25\% reduction in the number of tracks detected.},

	abstract = {Changes in global-mean precipitation are strongly constrained by global radiative cooling, while regional rainfall changes are less constrained because energy can be transported. Absorbing and non-absorbing aerosols have different effects on both global-mean and regional precipitation, due to the distinct effects on energetics. This study analyses the precipitation responses to large perturbations in black carbon (BC) and sulfate (SUL) by examining the changes in atmospheric energy budget terms on global and regional scales, in terms of fast (independent of changes in sea surface temperature, SST) and slow responses (mediated by changes in SST). Changes in atmospheric radiative cooling/heating are further decomposed into contributions from clouds, aerosols, and clear–clean sky (without clouds or aerosols). Both cases show a decrease in global-mean precipitation, which is dominated by fast responses in the BC case and slow responses in the SUL case. The geographical patterns are distinct too. The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), accompanied by tropical rainfall, shifts northward in the BC case, while it shifts southward in the SUL case. For both cases, energy transport terms from the slow response dominate the changes in tropical rainfall, which are associated with the northward (southward) shift of the Hadley cell in response to the enhanced southward (northward) cross-equatorial energy flux caused by increased BC (SUL) emission. The extra-tropical precipitation decreases in both cases. For the BC case, fast responses to increased atmospheric radiative heating contribute most to the reduced rainfall, in which absorbing aerosols directly heat the mid-troposphere, stabilise the column, and suppress precipitation. Unlike BC, non-absorbing aerosols decrease surface temperatures through slow processes, cool the whole atmospheric column, and reduce specific humidity, which leads to decreased radiative cooling from the clear–clean sky, which is consistent with the reduced rainfall. Examining the changes in large-scale circulation and local thermodynamics qualitatively explains the responses of precipitation to aerosol perturbations, whereas the energetic perspective provides a method to quantify their contributions.},

Rapid atmospheric adjustments reduce the instantaneous radiative forcing by nearly 50\% (multi-model mean), substantially lowering the net warming.

State-of-the-art Earth system models can provide detailed insight into these impacts, but have a large associated computational cost on a per-scenario basis. This large computational burden has driven recent interest in developing cheap machine learning models for the task of climate model emulation. In this manuscript, we explore the efficacy of randomly wired neural networks for this task. We describe how they can be constructed and compare them to their standard feedforward counterparts using the ClimateBench dataset. Specifically, we replace the serially connected dense layers in multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and convolutional long short-term memory networks with randomly wired dense layers and assess the impact on model performance for models with 1 million and 10 million parameters. We find that models with less complex architectures see the greatest performance improvement with the addition of random wiring (up to 30.4\% for multilayer perceptrons). Furthermore, out of 24 different model architecture, parameter count, and prediction task combinations, only one saw a statistically significant performance deficit in randomly wired networks compared to their standard counterparts, with 14 cases showing statistically significant improvement. We also find no significant difference in prediction speed between networks with standard feedforward dense layers and those with randomly wired layers. These findings indicate that randomly wired neural networks may be suitable direct replacements for traditional dense layers in many standard models.},

To get a better understanding of the impact of these biomass burning aerosols on clouds and the radiation balance over the SEA, the latest generation of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) is employed. Measurements from the CLARIFY and ORACLES flight campaigns are used to evaluate the model, demonstrating that the model has good skill in reproducing the biomass burning plume. To investigate the underlying mechanisms in detail, the effects of biomass burning aerosols on the clouds are decomposed into radiative effects (via absorption and scattering) and microphysical effects (via perturbation of cloud condensation nuclei – CCN – and cloud microphysical processes). July–August means are used to characterize aerosols, clouds, and the radiation balance during the fire season. Results show that around 65 \% of CCN at 0.2 \% supersaturation in the SEA can be attributed to biomass burning. The absorption effect of biomass burning aerosols is the most significant on clouds and radiation. Near the continent, it increases the supersaturation diagnosed by the activation scheme, while further from the continent it reduces the altitude of the supersaturation. As a result, the cloud droplet number concentration responds with a similar pattern to the absorption effect of biomass burning aerosols. The microphysical effect, however, decreases the supersaturation and increases the cloud droplet concentration over the ocean, although this change is relatively small. The liquid water path is also significantly increased over the SEA (mainly caused by the absorption effect of biomass burning aerosols) when biomass burning aerosols are above the stratocumulus cloud deck. The microphysical pathways lead to a slight increase in the liquid water path over the ocean. These changes in cloud properties indicate the significant role of biomass burning aerosols for clouds in this region. Among the effects of biomass burning aerosols on the radiation balance, the semi-direct radiative effects (rapid adjustments induced by the radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols) have a dominant cooling impact over the SEA, which offset the warming direct radiative effect (radiative forcing from biomass burning aerosol–radiation interactions) and lead to an overall net cooling radiative effect in the SEA. However, the magnitude and the sign of the semi-direct effects are sensitive to the relative location of biomass burning aerosols and clouds, reflecting the critical task of the accurate modelling of the biomass burning plume and clouds in this region.},

	abstract = {Water vapour in the atmosphere is the source of a major climate feedback mechanism and potential increases in the availability of water vapour could have important consequences for mean and extreme precipitation. Future precipitation changes further depend on how the hydrological cycle responds to different drivers of climate change, such as greenhouse gases and aerosols. Currently, neither the total anthropogenic influence on the hydrological cycle nor that from individual drivers is constrained sufficiently to make solid projections. We investigate how integrated water vapour (IWV) responds to different drivers of climate change. Results from 11 global climate models have been used, based on simulations where CO2, methane, solar irradiance, black carbon (BC), and sulfate have been perturbed separately. While the global-mean IWV is usually assumed to increase by ∼7 \% per kelvin of surface temperature change, we find that the feedback response of IWV differs somewhat between drivers. Fast responses, which include the initial radiative effect and rapid adjustments to an external forcing, amplify these differences. The resulting net changes in IWV range from 6.4±0.9 \% K-1 for sulfate to 9.8±2 \% K-1 for BC. We further calculate the relationship between global changes in IWV and precipitation, which can be characterized by quantifying changes in atmospheric water vapour lifetime. Global climate models simulate a substantial increase in the lifetime, from 8.2±0.5 to 9.9±0.7 d between 1986–2005 and 2081–2100 under a high-emission scenario, and we discuss to what extent the water vapour lifetime provides additional information compared to analysis of IWV and precipitation separately. We conclude that water vapour lifetime changes are an important indicator of changes in precipitation patterns and that BC is particularly efficient in prolonging the mean time, and therefore likely the distance, between evaporation and precipitation.},

	abstract = {Black Carbon (BC) aerosols substantially affect the global climate. However, accurate simulation of BC atmospheric transport remains elusive, due to shortcomings in modeling and a shortage of constraining measurements. Recently, several studies have compared simulations with observed vertical concentration profiles, and diagnosed a global-mean BC atmospheric residence time of {\textless}5 days. These studies have, however, been focused on limited geographical regions, and used temporally and spatially coarse model information. Here we expand on previous results by comparing a wide range of recent aircraft measurements from multiple regions, including the Arctic and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, to simulated distributions obtained at varying spatial and temporal resolution. By perturbing BC removal processes and using current best-estimate emissions, we confirm a constraint on the global-mean BC lifetime of {\textless}5.5 days, shorter than in many current global models, over a broader geographical range than has so far been possible. Sampling resolution influences the results, although generally without introducing major bias. However, we uncover large regional differences in the diagnosed lifetime, in particular in the Arctic. We also find that only a weak constraint can be placed in the African outflow region over the South Atlantic, indicating inaccurate emission sources or model representation of transport and microphysical processes. While our results confirm that BC lifetime is shorter than predicted by most recent climate models, they also cast doubt on the usability of the concept of a “global-mean BC lifetime” for climate impact studies, or as an indicator of model skill. A geographically wide set of aircraft measurements show that the lifetime of black carbon aerosols in the atmosphere is less than five days. Chemical transport simulations are key for assessing the climate impact of black carbon aerosols, but their evaluation has been limited by sparse observations. Marianne T. Lund, from the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, and colleagues compare a wide range of aircraft black carbon concentrations from 2008–2017 with two chemistry transport models to confirm a short black carbon lifetime of less than 5 days. While this global mean lifetime applies over a wide geographical range, they also find important regional discrepancies, in particular in the Arctic. These findings caution against using a global-mean lifetime to diagnose the impact of black carbon on warming.},

A key first step in reducing this uncertainty is to accurately classify cloud types at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, we introduce Cumulo, a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating global cloud classification models. It consists of one year of 1km resolution MODIS hyperspectral imagery merged with pixel-width 'tracks' of CloudSat cloud labels. Bringing these complementary datasets together is a crucial first step, enabling the Machine-Learning community to develop innovative new techniques which could greatly benefit the Climate community. To showcase Cumulo, we provide baseline performance analysis using an invertible flow generative model (IResNet), which further allows us to discover new sub-classes for a given cloud class by exploring the latent space. To compare methods, we introduce a set of evaluation criteria, to identify models that are not only accurate, but also physically-realistic.

	abstract = {The change in planetary albedo due to aerosol−cloud interactions during the industrial era is the leading source of uncertainty in inferring Earth’s climate sensitivity to increased greenhouse gases from the historical record. The variable that controls aerosol−cloud interactions in warm clouds is droplet number concentration. Global climate models demonstrate that the present-day hemispheric contrast in cloud droplet number concentration between the pristine Southern Hemisphere and the polluted Northern Hemisphere oceans can be used as a proxy for anthropogenically driven change in cloud droplet number concentration. Remotely sensed estimates constrain this change in droplet number concentration to be between 8 cm−3 and 24 cm−3. By extension, the radiative forcing since 1850 from aerosol−cloud interactions is constrained to be −1.2 W⋅m−2 to −0.6 W⋅m−2. The robustness of this constraint depends upon the assumption that pristine Southern Ocean droplet number concentration is a suitable proxy for preindustrial concentrations. Droplet number concentrations calculated from satellite data over the Southern Ocean are high in austral summer. Near Antarctica, they reach values typical of Northern Hemisphere polluted outflows. These concentrations are found to agree with several in situ datasets. In contrast, climate models show systematic underpredictions of cloud droplet number concentration across the Southern Ocean. Near Antarctica, where precipitation sinks of aerosol are small, the underestimation by climate models is particularly large. This motivates the need for detailed process studies of aerosol production and aerosol−cloud interactions in pristine environments. The hemispheric difference in satellite estimated cloud droplet number concentration implies preindustrial aerosol concentrations were higher than estimated by most models.},

This increases cloud droplet numbers, which in turn affects other cloud properties like liquid-water content and ultimately cloud albedo. These adjustments are poorly constrained, making aerosol effects the most uncertain part of anthropogenic climate forcing. Here we show that cloud droplet number and water content react differently to changing emission amounts in shipping exhausts. We use information about ship positions and modeled emission amounts together with reanalysis winds and satellite retrievals of cloud properties. The analysis reveals that cloud droplet numbers respond linearly to emission amount over a large range (1–10 kg h-1) before the response saturates. Liquid water increases in raining clouds, and the anomalies are constant over the emission ranges observed. There is evidence that this independence of emissions is due to compensating effects under drier and more humid conditions, consistent with suppression of rain by enhanced aerosol. This has implications for our understanding of cloud processes and may improve the way clouds are represented in climate models, in particular by changing parameterizations of liquid-water responses to aerosol.},

Clouds play a critical role in moderating global temperatures and small perturbations can lead to significant amounts of cooling or warming. Uncertainty in this effect is so large it is not currently known if it is negligible, or provides a large enough cooling to largely negate present-day warming by CO2.

This uncertainty arises in part from the difficulty in measuring the vertical distributions of aerosols, and only sporadic vertically resolved observations are available. We often have to settle for less informative vertically aggregated proxies such as aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this work, we develop a framework for the vertical disaggregation of AOD into extinction profiles, that is, the measure of light extinction throughout an atmospheric column, using readily available vertically resolved meteorological predictors such as temperature, pressure, or relative humidity. Using Bayesian nonparametric modeling, we devise a simple Gaussian process prior over aerosol vertical profiles and update it with AOD observations to infer a distribution over vertical extinction profiles. To validate our approach, we use ECHAM-HAM aerosol-climate model data which offers self-consistent simulations of meteorological covariates, AOD, and extinction profiles. Our results show that, while very simple, our model is able to reconstruct realistic extinction profiles with well-calibrated uncertainty, outperforming by an order of magnitude the idealized baseline which is typically used in satellite AOD retrieval algorithms. In particular, the model demonstrates a faithful reconstruction of extinction patterns arising from aerosol water uptake in the boundary layer. Observations however suggest that other extinction patterns, due to aerosol mass concentration, particle size, and radiative properties, might be more challenging to capture and require additional vertically resolved predictors.},

The nonlinearity of cloud-state changes to aerosol perturbations make it challenging to attribute causality in observed relationships of aerosol radiative forcing. Using correlations to infer causality can be challenging when meteorological variability also drives both aerosol and cloud changes independently. Natural and anthropogenic aerosol perturbations from well-defined sources provide “opportunistic experiments” (also known as natural experiments) to investigate ACI in cases where causality may be more confidently inferred. These perturbations cover a wide range of locations and spatiotemporal scales, including point sources such as volcanic eruptions or industrial sources, plumes from biomass burning or forest fires, and tracks from individual ships or shipping corridors. We review the different experimental conditions and conduct a synthesis of the available satellite datasets and field campaigns to place these opportunistic experiments on a common footing, facilitating new insights and a clearer understanding of key uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing. Cloud albedo perturbations are strongly sensitive to background meteorological conditions. Strong liquid water path increases due to aerosol perturbations are largely ruled out by averaging across experiments. Opportunistic experiments have significantly improved process-level understanding of ACI, but it remains unclear how reliably the relationships found can be scaled to the global level, thus demonstrating a need for deeper investigation in order to improve assessments of aerosol radiative forcing and climate change.},

Model results for the period 2011–2015 are compared with aerosol measurements (aerosol particle number, CCN and aerosol particle composition in the submicron fraction) from nine surface stations located in Europe and Japan. The evaluation focuses on the ability of models to simulate the average across time state in diverse environments and on the seasonal and short-term variability in the aerosol properties.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}There is no single model that systematically performs best across all environments represented by the observations.

However, they seem to behave differently for particles activating at very low supersaturations ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\&amp;lt;0.1{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&amp;thinsp;\%) than at higher ones. A total of 15 models have been used to produce ensemble annual median distributions of relevant parameters.

In addition, simulated CDNC is in slightly better agreement with observationally derived values at lower than at higher updraft velocities (index of agreement 0.64 vs. 0.65). The reduced spread of CDNC compared to that of CCN is attributed to the sublinear response of CDNC to aerosol particle number variations and the negative correlation between the sensitivities of CDNC to aerosol particle number concentration ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M15" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}∂{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}N{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}d{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}/{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}∂{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}N{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}a{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}{\textless}span{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="48pt" height="14pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="9faa6b9bc700a00532091cfd69cae419"{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="acp-19-8591-2019-ie00001.svg" width="48pt" height="14pt" src="acp-19-8591-2019-ie00001.png"/{\textgreater}{\textless}/svg:svg{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and to updraft velocity ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M16" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}∂{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}N{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}d{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}/{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}∂{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}w{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}{\textless}span{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="43pt" height="14pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="9a0c289e263af38b17f8d2715a056c8f"{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="acp-19-8591-2019-ie00002.svg" width="43pt" height="14pt" src="acp-19-8591-2019-ie00002.png"/{\textgreater}{\textless}/svg:svg{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}).

This in turn leads to large uncertainties in the contributions of the direct and indirect aerosol forcing on climate. Using the Global Aerosol Synthesis and Science Project (GASSP) database – the largest synthesised collection of in situ aircraft measurements currently available, with more than 1000 flights from 37 campaigns from around the world – we investigate the vertical structure of submicron aerosols across a wide range of regions and environments. The application of this unique dataset to assess the vertical distributions of number size distribution and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the global aerosol–climate model ECHAM-HAM reveals that the model underestimates accumulation-mode particles in the upper troposphere, especially in remote regions. The processes underlying this discrepancy are explored using different aerosol microphysical schemes and a process sensitivity analysis. These show that the biases are predominantly related to aerosol ageing and removal rather than emissions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The south-east Atlantic is a region where high atmospheric aerosol loadings and semi-permanent stratocumulus clouds are co-located, providing an optimum region for studying the full range of aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions and their perturbations of the Earth's radiation budget. While satellite measurements have provided some useful insights into aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions over the region, these observations do not have the spatial and temporal resolution, nor the required level of precision to allow for a process-level assessment. Detailed measurements from high spatial and temporal resolution airborne atmospheric measurements in the region are very sparse, limiting their use in assessing the performance of aerosol modelling in numerical weather prediction and climate models. CLARIFY-2017 was a major consortium programme consisting of five principal UK universities with project partners from the UK Met Office and European- and USA-based universities and research centres involved in the complementary ORACLES, LASIC, and AEROCLO-sA projects. The aims of CLARIFY-2017 were fourfold: (1) to improve the representation and reduce uncertainty in model estimates of the direct, semi-direct, and indirect radiative effect of absorbing biomass burning aerosols; (2) to improve our knowledge and representation of the processes determining stratocumulus cloud microphysical and radiative properties and their transition to cumulus regimes; (3) to challenge, validate, and improve satellite retrievals of cloud and aerosol properties and their radiative impacts; (4) to improve the impacts of aerosols in weather and climate numerical models. This paper describes the modelling and measurement strategies central to the CLARIFY-2017 deployment of the FAAM BAe146 instrumented aircraft campaign, summarizes the flight objectives and flight patterns, and highlights some key results from our initial analyses.},

Increased aerosol concentrations due to human activity affect droplet number concentration, liquid water and cloud fraction2, but these changes are subject to large uncertainties3. Ship tracks, long lines of polluted clouds that are visible in satellite images, are one of the main tools for quantifying aerosol–cloud interactions4. However, only a small fraction of the clouds polluted by shipping show ship tracks5,6. Here we show that even when no ship tracks are visible in satellite images, aerosol emissions change cloud properties substantially. We develop a new method to quantify the effect of shipping on all clouds, showing a cloud droplet number increase and a more positive liquid water response when there are no visible tracks. We directly detect shipping-induced cloud property changes in the trade cumulus regions of the Atlantic, which are known to display almost no visible tracks. Our results indicate that previous studies of ship tracks were suffering from selection biases by focusing only on visible tracks from satellite imagery. The strong liquid water path response we find translates to a larger aerosol cooling effect on the climate, potentially masking a higher climate sensitivity than observed temperature trends would otherwise suggest. Investigations of the effect of aerosol emissions from shipping on cloud properties when both visible and invisible ship tracks are considered implies a large negative radiative effect (and associated cooling) from liquid water path adjustments.},

Understanding these changes in precipitation has proven particularly difficult for the case of absorbing aerosol, which absorbs a significant amount of incoming solar radiation and hence acts as a source of localized diabatic heating to the atmosphere. In this work, we use an ensemble of atmosphere-only climate model simulations forced by identical absorbing aerosol perturbations in different geographical locations across the globe to develop a basic physical understanding of how this localized heating impacts the atmosphere and how these changes impact on precipitation both globally and locally. In agreement with previous studies we find that absorbing aerosol causes a decrease in global-mean precipitation, but we also show that even for identical aerosol optical depth perturbations, the global-mean precipitation change varies by over an order-of-magnitude depending on the location of the aerosol burden. Our experiments also demonstrate that the local precipitation response to absorbing aerosol is opposite in sign between the tropics and the extratropics, as found by previous work. We then show that this contrasting response can be understood in terms of different mechanisms by which the large-scale circulation responds to heating in the extratropics and in the tropics. We provide a simple theory to explain variations in the local precipitation response to absorbing aerosol in the tropics. Our work highlights that the spatial pattern of absorbing aerosol and its interactions with circulation are a key determinant of its overall climate impact and must be taken into account when developing our understanding of aerosol-climate interactions.},

This is done with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6), the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). We apply the PPE method to CESM2–CAM6 to understand climate sensitivity to atmospheric physics parameters. The initial simulations vary 45 parameters in the microphysics, convection, turbulence and aerosol schemes with 263 ensemble members. These atmospheric parameters are typically the most uncertain in many climate models. Control simulations and targeted simulations to understand climate forcing due to aerosols and fast climate feedbacks are analyzed. The use of various emulators is explored in the multi-dimensional space mapping input parameters to output metrics. Parameter impacts on various model outputs, such as radiation, cloud and aerosol properties, are evaluated. Machine learning is also used to probe optimal parameter values against observations. Our findings show that PPE is a valuable tool for climate uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, by varying many parameters simultaneously, we find that many different combinations of parameter values can produce results consistent with observations, and thus careful analysis of tuning is important. The CESM2–CAM6 PPE is publicly available and extensible to other configurations to address questions of other model processes in the atmosphere and other model components (e.g., coupling to the land surface).},

	abstract = {The semi-permanent stratocumulus clouds over the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean (SEA) can act as an “air conditioner” to the regional and global climate system. The interaction of aerosols and clouds becomes important in this region and can lead to negative radiative effects, partially offsetting the positive radiative forcing of greenhouse gases. A key pathway by which aerosols affect cloud properties is by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). In this paper, we use the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1) to investigate the sources of CCN (from emissions and atmospheric processes) in the SEA as well as the response of the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the cloud liquid water path (LWP), and radiative forcing to these sources during 2016 and 2017. Overall, free and upper troposphere nucleated aerosols are the dominant source of the boundary layer CCN concentration at 0.2 \% supersaturation (CCN0.2\%), contributing an annual average of ∼ 41 \% as they subside and entrain into the marine boundary layer, which is consistent with observations highlighting the important role of nucleation in the boundary layer CCN concentration. In terms of emission sources, anthropogenic emissions (from energy, industry, agriculture, etc.) contribute the most to the annual average CCN0.2\% in the marine boundary layer (∼ 26 \%), followed by biomass burning (BB, ∼ 17 \%). In the cloud layer, BB contributes about 34 \% of the annual CCN0.2\%, midway between the contributions from aerosol nucleation (36 \%) and anthropogenic sources (31 \%). The contribution of aerosols from different sources to the CDNC is consistent with their contribution to CCN0.2\% within the marine boundary layer, with free and upper troposphere aerosol nucleation being the most important source of the CDNC overall. In terms of emission sources, anthropogenic sources are also the largest contributors to the annual average CDNC, closely followed by BB. However, during the BB season, BB and free and upper troposphere aerosol nucleation are equally the most important sources of the CDNC. The contribution of BB to the CDNC is more significant than its increase to CCN0.2\%, mainly because BB aerosols are mostly located directly above the inversion layer in the model; thus, they can increase the in-cloud CDNC by enhancing the supersaturation through the dynamical feedback due to short-wave absorption. An aerosol source that shows an increase in the CDNC also shows an increase in the LWP resulting from a reduction in autoconversion. Due to the absorption effect, BB aerosol can enhance existing temperature inversions and reduce the entrainment of sub-saturated air, leading to a further increase in the LWP. As a result, the contribution of BB to the LWP is second only to aerosol nucleation on annual averages. These findings demonstrate that BB is not the dominant source of CCN within the marine boundary layer from an emission source perspective. However, as most BB aerosols are located directly above the inversion layer, their effect on clouds increases due to their absorption effect (about the same as anthropogenic sources for the CDNC and more than anthropogenic sources for the LWP), highlighting the crucial role of their radiative effect on clouds. The results on the radiative effects of aerosols show that BB aerosol exhibits an overall positive RFari (radiative forcing associated with aerosol–radiation interactions), but its net effective radiative forcing remains negative due to its effect on clouds (mainly due to its absorbing effect). By quantifying aerosol and cloud properties affected by different sources, this paper provides a framework for understanding the effects of aerosol sources on marine stratocumulus clouds and radiation in the SEA.},

	abstract = {While carbon dioxide is the main cause for global warming, modeling short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) such as methane, ozone, and particles in the Arctic allows us to simulate near-term climate and health impacts for a sensitive, pristine region that is warming at 3 times the global rate. Atmospheric modeling is critical for understanding the long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic, as well as the abundance and distribution of SLCFs throughout the Arctic atmosphere. Modeling is also used as a tool to determine SLCF impacts on climate and health in the present and in future emissions scenarios. In this study, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art atmospheric and Earth system models by assessing their representation of Arctic and Northern Hemisphere atmospheric SLCF distributions, considering a wide range of different chemical species (methane, tropospheric ozone and its precursors, black carbon, sulfate, organic aerosol, and particulate matter) and multiple observational datasets. Model simulations over 4 years (2008–2009 and 2014–2015) conducted for the 2022 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) SLCF assessment report are thoroughly evaluated against satellite, ground, ship, and aircraft-based observations. The annual means, seasonal cycles, and 3-D distributions of SLCFs were evaluated using several metrics, such as absolute and percent model biases and correlation coefficients. The results show a large range in model performance, with no one particular model or model type performing well for all regions and all SLCF species. The multi-model mean (mmm) was able to represent the general features of SLCFs in the Arctic and had the best overall performance. For the SLCFs with the greatest radiative impact (CH4, O3, BC, and SO42-), the mmm was within ±25 \% of the measurements across the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, we recommend a multi-model ensemble be used for simulating climate and health impacts of SLCFs. Of the SLCFs in our study, model biases were smallest for CH4 and greatest for OA. For most SLCFs, model biases skewed from positive to negative with increasing latitude. Our analysis suggests that vertical mixing, long-range transport, deposition, and wildfires remain highly uncertain processes. These processes need better representation within atmospheric models to improve their simulation of SLCFs in the Arctic environment. As model development proceeds in these areas, we highly recommend that the vertical and 3-D distribution of SLCFs be evaluated, as that information is critical to improving the uncertain processes in models.},

Both the host atmospheric climate model ECHAM6.3 and the aerosol model HAM2.3 were updated from previous versions. The updated version of the HAM aerosol model contains improved parameterizations of aerosol processes such as cloud activation, as well as updated emission fields for anthropogenic aerosol species and modifications in the online computation of sea salt and mineral dust aerosol emissions. Aerosol results from nudged and free-running simulations for the 10-year period 2003 to 2012 are compared to various measurements of aerosol properties. While there are regional deviations between the model and observations, the model performs well overall in terms of aerosol optical thickness, but may underestimate coarse-mode aerosol concentrations to some extent so that the modeled particles are smaller than indicated by the observations. Sulfate aerosol measurements in the US and Europe are reproduced well by the model, while carbonaceous aerosol species are biased low. Both mineral dust and sea salt aerosol concentrations are improved compared to previous versions of ECHAM–HAM. The evaluation of the simulated aerosol distributions serves as a basis for the suitability of the model for simulating aerosol–climate interactions in a changing climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract The effects of anthropogenic aerosol, solid or liquid particles suspended in the air, are the biggest contributor to uncertainty in current climate perturbations. Heavy industry sites, such as coal power plants and steel manufacturers, large sources of greenhouse gases, also emit large amounts of aerosol in a small area. This makes them ideal places to study aerosol interactions with radiation and clouds. However, existing data sets of heavy industry locations are either not public, or suffer from reporting gaps. Here, we develop a supervised deep learning algorithm to detect unreported industry sites in high-resolution satellite data, using the existing data sets for training. For the pipeline to be viable at global scale, we employ a two-step approach. The first step uses 10 m resolution data, which is scanned for potential industry sites, before using 1.2 m resolution images to confirm or reject detections. On held-out test data, the models perform well, with the lower resolution one reaching up to 94\% accuracy. Deployed to a large test region, the first stage model yields many false positive detections. The second stage, higher resolution model shows promising results at filtering these out, while keeping the true positives, improving the precision to 42\% overall, so that human review becomes feasible. In the deployment area, we find five new heavy industry sites which were not in the training data. This demonstrates that the approach can be used to complement existing data sets of heavy industry sites.},

	abstract = {Global climate change projections are subject to substantial modelling uncertainties. A variety of emergent constraints, as well as several other statistical model evaluation approaches, have been suggested to address these uncertainties. However, they remain heavily debated in the climate science community. Still, the central idea to relate future model projections to already observable quantities has no real substitute. Here, we highlight the validation perspective of predictive skill in the machine learning community as a promising alternative viewpoint. Specifically, we argue for quantitative approaches in which each suggested constraining relationship can be evaluated comprehensively based on out-of-sample test data – on top of qualitative physical plausibility arguments that are already commonplace in the justification of new emergent constraints. Building on this perspective, we review machine learning ideas for new types of controlling-factor analyses (CFAs). The principal idea behind these CFAs is to use machine learning to find climate-invariant relationships in historical data which hold approximately under strong climate change scenarios. On the basis of existing data archives, these climate-invariant relationships can be validated in perfect-climate-model frameworks. From a machine learning perspective, we argue that such approaches are promising for three reasons: (a) they can be objectively validated for both past data and future data, (b) they provide more direct – and, by design, physically plausible – links between historical observations and potential future climates, and (c) they can take high-dimensional and complex relationships into account in the functions learned to constrain the future response. We demonstrate these advantages for two recently published CFA examples in the form of constraints on climate feedback mechanisms (clouds, stratospheric water vapour) and discuss further challenges and opportunities using the example of a rapid adjustment mechanism (aerosol–cloud interactions). We highlight several avenues for future work, including strategies to address non-linearity, to tackle blind spots in climate model ensembles, to integrate helpful physical priors into Bayesian methods, to leverage physics-informed machine learning, and to enhance robustness through causal discovery and inference.},

	abstract = {This work presents the first step in the development of the VISION toolkit, a set of Python tools that allows easy, efficient, and more meaningful comparison between global atmospheric models and observational data. Whilst observational data and modelling capabilities are expanding in parallel, there are still barriers preventing these two data sources from being used in synergy. This arises from differences in spatial and temporal sampling between models and observational platforms: observational data from a research aircraft, for example, are sampled on specified flight trajectories at very high temporal resolution. Proper comparison with model data requires generating, storing, and handling a large number of highly temporally resolved model files, resulting in a process which is data-, labour-, and time-intensive. In this paper we focus on comparison between model data and in situ observations (from aircraft, ships, buoys, sondes, etc.). A standalone code, In-Situ Observations Simulator, or ISO\_simulator for short, is described here: this software reads modelled variables and observational data files and outputs model data interpolated in space and time to match observations. These model data are then written to NetCDF files that can be efficiently archived due to their small sizes and directly compared to observations. This method achieves a large reduction in the size of model data being produced for comparison with flight and other in situ data. By interpolating global gridded hourly files onto observation locations, we reduce data output for a typical climate resolution run, from ∼3 Gb per model variable per month to ∼15 Mb per model variable per month (a 200-times reduction in data volume). The VISION toolkit is relatively fast to run and can be automated to process large volumes of data at once, allowing efficient data analysis over a large number of years. Although this code was initially tested within the Unified Model (UM) framework, which is shared by the UK Earth System Model (UKESM), it was written as a flexible tool and it can be extended to work with other models.},

	abstract = {We assessed the biomass burning (BB) smoke aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulations of 11 global models that participated in the AeroCom phase III BB emission experiment. By comparing multi-model simulations and satellite observations in the vicinity of fires over 13 regions globally, we (1) assess model-simulated BB AOD performance as an indication of smoke source–strength, (2) identify regions where the common emission dataset used by the models might underestimate or overestimate smoke sources, and (3) assess model diversity and identify underlying causes as much as possible. Using satellite-derived AOD snapshots to constrain source strength works best where BB smoke from active sources dominates background non-BB aerosol, such as in boreal forest regions and over South America and southern hemispheric Africa. The comparison is inconclusive where the total AOD is low, as in many agricultural burning areas, and where the background is high, such as parts of India and China. Many inter-model BB AOD differences can be traced to differences in values for the mass ratio of organic aerosol to organic carbon, the BB aerosol mass extinction efficiency, and the aerosol loss rate from each model. The results point to a need for increased numbers of available BB cases for study in some regions and especially to a need for more extensive regional-to-global-scale measurements of aerosol loss rates and of detailed particle microphysical and optical properties; this would both better constrain models and help distinguish BB from other aerosol types in satellite retrievals. More generally, there is the need for additional efforts at constraining aerosol source strength and other model attributes with multi-platform observations.},

	abstract = {Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions, to map observational time series to latent representations. Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability. Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data. An implementation of SPACY is available at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/SPACY/\}},

Traditional methods relying on Gaussian processes can hardly scale to high-dimensional data. Deep learning approaches utilize neural network based encoders and decoders to improve scalability.

This hinders inference performance, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios when the highest fidelity data has limited domain coverage. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-fidelity Residual Neural Processes (MFRNP), a novel multi-fidelity surrogate modeling framework. MFRNP explicitly models the residual between the aggregated output from lower fidelities and ground truth at the highest fidelity. The aggregation introduces decoders into the information sharing step and optimizes lower fidelity decoders to accurately capture both in-fidelity and cross-fidelity information.

The analysis is framed on the extreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the Oroville Dam spillway incident in Northern California. “Past” and “future” simulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the preindustrial and the late twenty-first century temperature climate change signals, respectively. The simulations are compared to the results from a dynamical model which represents plausible “pseudorealities” under both climate environments. Overall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5\%–6\% increase in the integrated water vapor over the Oroville Dam in the present day compared to the preindustrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different geopotential–moisture–temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the AI models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the physicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to simulate weaker attribution values than the “pseudoreality” imagined by the dynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for the late twenty-first century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model ({\textgreater}500 members) produced statistically significant present-day to preindustrial attribution results, unlike the {\textgreater}20-member ensemble from the dynamical model. This analysis highlights the potential of AI models to conduct the attribution analysis, while emphasizing future lines of work on explainable artificial intelligence to gain confidence in these tools, which can enable reliable attribution studies in real time. Significance Statement Large volumes of greenhouse gasses are continuously emitted into the air, warming Earth’s atmosphere, and increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts, and heavy precipitation. Climate attribution by means of the storyline approach aims to quantify the human fingerprint in observed extreme events to establish a connection between climate change and the weather we experience. Attribution studies currently rely on dynamical models to simulate the climate system, which require huge computational resources and demand long simulation times, limiting the number of events analyzed and preventing reports to be published in near–real time, where public attention is at its peak. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) data-driven models are examined for this task.},

	abstract = {Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and data sets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We compare these deep learning emulators with a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and show that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally resolved climate variables, notably surface temperature and precipitation. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. Precipitation is a much more noisy variable, and we show that deep learning emulators can overfit to internal variability noise at low frequencies, degrading their performance in comparison to a linear emulator. We address the issue of overfitting by increasing the number of climate simulations per emission pathway (from 3 to 50) and updating the benchmark targets with the respective ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based technique for emulating precipitation.

	abstract = {In 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented strict new regulations on the emissions of sulfate aerosol from the world's shipping fleet. This can be expected to lead to a reduction in aerosol-driven cooling, unmasking a portion of greenhouse gas warming. The magnitude of the effect is uncertain, however, due to the large remaining uncertainties in the climate response to aerosols. Here, we investigate this question using an 18-member ensemble of fully coupled climate simulations evenly sampling key modes of climate variability with the NCAR model, the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). We show that, while there is a clear physical response of the climate system to the IMO regulations, including a surface temperature increase, we do not find global mean temperature influence that is significantly different from zero. The 20-year average global mean warming for 2020–2040 is +0.03 °C, with a 5 \%–95 \% confidence range of [-0.09,0.19], reflecting the weakness of the perturbation relative to internal variability. We do, however, find a robust, non-zero regional temperature response in part of the North Atlantic. We also find that the maximum annual mean and ensemble mean warming occurs around 1 decade after the perturbation in 2029, which means that the IMO regulations have likely had very limited influence on observed global warming to date. We further discuss our results in light of other, recent publications that have reached different conclusions. Overall, while the IMO regulations may contribute up to 0.16 °C [-0.17,0.52] to the global mean surface temperature in individual years during this decade, consistent with some early studies, such a response is unlikely to have been discernible above internal variability by the end of 2023 and is in fact consistent with zero throughout the 2020–2040 period.},

Here, sensitivities from an AI model at 36-h lead time were compared to those produced by an adjoint of a dynamical model for an extreme weather event, cyclone Xynthia, presenting very similar structures and with the evolved perturbations leading to similar impacts. This demonstrates the ability of the AI weather model to learn physically meaningful spatio-temporal links between atmospheric processes.

Yet not all climate interactions are fully understood, and uncertainty in climate model results persists, as assessed in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. We synthesize current challenges and emphasize opportunities for advancing our understanding of the interactions between atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate change, as well as for quantifying model diversity. Our perspective is based on expert views from three multi-model intercomparison projects (MIPs) – the Precipitation Driver Response MIP (PDRMIP), the Aerosol Chemistry MIP (AerChemMIP), and the Radiative Forcing MIP (RFMIP). While there are many shared interests and specializations across the MIPs, they have their own scientific foci and specific approaches. The partial overlap between the MIPs proved useful for advancing the understanding of the perturbation–response paradigm through multi-model ensembles of Earth system models of varying complexity. We discuss the challenges of gaining insights from Earth system models that face computational and process representation limits and provide guidance from our lessons learned. Promising ideas to overcome some long-standing challenges in the near future are kilometer-scale experiments to better simulate circulation-dependent processes where it is possible and machine learning approaches where they are needed, e.g., for faster and better subgrid-scale parameterizations and pattern recognition in big data. New model constraints can arise from augmented observational products that leverage multiple datasets with machine learning approaches. Future MIPs can develop smart experiment protocols that strive towards an optimal trade-off between the resolution, complexity, and number of simulations and their length and, thereby, help to advance the understanding of climate change and its impacts.},

Aerosol forcing through aerosol-cloud interactions is mostly negative (a cooling) due to shortwave radiation, while feedbacks are positive or negative in different regions due to contrasting longwave and shortwave effects. Both forcing and feedbacks are related to the mean climate state. Higher magnitude cloud radiative effects generally mean larger magnitude net negative forcing and larger magnitude net positive feedback. Aerosol forcing is broadly related to the susceptibility of clouds to drop number. Feedbacks also related to susceptibility, but to a lesser extent and in different regions to aerosol forcing. Aerosol forcing and cloud feedbacks are anti-correlated in the CAM6 PPE such that stronger negative forcing is associated with stronger positive feedbacks. Even the processes governing forcing and feedback sensitivity in the PPE are similar. These include the warm rain formation process, ice loss processes and deep convective intensity.},

Analysis of recent temperature anomalies indicates Northern Hemisphere surface temperature anomalies in 2022–2023 are correlated with observed cloud radiative forcing and the cloud radiative forcing is spatially correlated with the simulated radiative forcing from the 2020 shipping emission changes.

	abstract = {Aerosol-induced absorption of shortwave radiation can modify the climate through local atmospheric heating, which affects lapse rates, precipitation, and cloud formation. Presently, the total amount of aerosol absorption is poorly constrained, and the main absorbing aerosol species (black carbon (BC), organic aerosols (OA), and mineral dust) are diversely quantified in global climate models. As part of the third phase of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) intercomparison initiative (AeroCom phase III), we here document the distribution and magnitude of aerosol absorption in current global aerosol models and quantify the sources of intermodel spread, highlighting the difficulties of attributing absorption to different species. In total, 15 models have provided total present-day absorption at 550 nm (using year 2010 emissions), 11 of which have provided absorption per absorbing species. The multi-model global annual mean total absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) is 0.0054 (0.0020 to 0.0098; 550 nm), with the range given as the minimum and maximum model values. This is 28 \% higher compared to the 0.0042 (0.0021 to 0.0076) multi-model mean in AeroCom phase II (using year 2000 emissions), but the difference is within 1 standard deviation, which, in this study, is 0.0023 (0.0019 in Phase II). Of the summed component AAOD, 60 \% (range 36 \%–84 \%) is estimated to be due to BC, 31 \% (12 \%–49 \%) is due to dust, and 11 \% (0 \%–24 \%) is due to OA; however, the components are not independent in terms of their absorbing efficiency. In models with internal mixtures of absorbing aerosols, a major challenge is the lack of a common and simple method to attribute absorption to the different absorbing species. Therefore, when possible, the models with internally mixed aerosols in the present study have performed simulations using the same method for estimating absorption due to BC, OA, and dust, namely by removing it and comparing runs with and without the absorbing species. We discuss the challenges of attributing absorption to different species; we compare burden, refractive indices, and density; and we contrast models with internal mixing to models with external mixing. The model mean BC mass absorption coefficient (MAC) value is 10.1 (3.1 to 17.7) m2 g−1 (550 nm), and the model mean BC AAOD is 0.0030 (0.0007 to 0.0077). The difference in lifetime (and burden) in the models explains as much of the BC AAOD spread as the difference in BC MAC values. The difference in the spectral dependency between the models is striking. Several models have an absorption Ångstrøm exponent (AAE) close to 1, which likely is too low given current knowledge of spectral aerosol optical properties. Most models do not account for brown carbon and underestimate the spectral dependency for OA.},

	abstract = {For over 6 months, the 2014–2015 effusive eruption at Holuhraun, Iceland, injected considerable amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the lower troposphere with a daily rate of up to one-third of the global emission rate, causing extensive air pollution across Europe. The large injection of SO2, which oxidises to form sulfate aerosol (SO42-), provides a natural experiment offering an ideal opportunity to scrutinise state-of-the-art general circulation models' (GCMs) representation of aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs). Here we present Part 1 of a two-part model inter-comparison using the Holuhraun eruption as a framework to analyse ACIs. We use SO2 retrievals from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument and ground-based measurements of SO2 and SO42- mass concentrations across Europe, in conjunction with a trajectory analysis using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, to assess the spatial and chemical evolution of the volcanic plume as simulated by five GCMs and a chemical transport model (CTM). IASI retrievals of plume altitude and SO2 column load reveal that the volcanic perturbation is largely contained within the lower troposphere. Compared to the satellite observations, the models capture the spatial evolution and vertical variability of the plume reasonably well, although the models often overestimate the plume altitude. HYSPLIT trajectories are used to attribute to Holuhraun emissions 111 instances of elevated sulfurous surface mass concentrations recorded at European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) stations during September and October 2014. Comparisons with the simulated concentrations show that the modelled ratio of SO2 to SO42- during these pollution episodes is often underestimated and overestimated for the young and mature plume, respectively. Models with finer vertical resolutions near the surface are found to better capture these elevated sulfurous ground-level concentrations. Using an exponential function to describe the decay of observed surface mass concentration ratios of SO2 to SO42- with plume age, the in-plume oxidation rate constant is estimated as 0.032 ± 0.002 h−1 (1.30 ± 0.08 d e-folding time), with a near-vent ratio of 25 ± 5 (µg m−3 of SO2 / µg m−3 of SO42-). The majority of the corresponding derived modelled oxidation rate constants are lower than the observed estimate. This suggests that the representation of the oxidation pathway/s in the simulated plumes is too slow. Overall, despite their coarse spatial resolutions, the six models show reasonable skill in capturing the spatial and chemical evolution of the Holuhraun plume. This capable representation of the underlying aerosol perturbation is essential to enable the investigation of the eruption's impact on ACIs in the second part of this study.},

	abstract = {Aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty affects estimates of climate sensitivity and limits model skill in terms of making climate projections. Efforts to improve the representations of physical processes in climate models, including extensive comparisons with observations, have not significantly constrained the range of possible aerosol forcing values. A far stronger constraint, in particular for the lower (most-negative) bound, can be achieved using global mean energy balance arguments based on observed changes in historical temperature. Here, we show that structural deficiencies in a climate model, revealed as inconsistencies among observationally constrained cloud properties in the model, limit the effectiveness of observational constraint of the uncertain physical processes. We sample the uncertainty in 37 model parameters related to aerosols, clouds, and radiation in a perturbed parameter ensemble of the UK Earth System Model and evaluate 1 million model variants (different parameter settings from Gaussian process emulators) against satellite-derived observations over several cloudy regions. Our analysis of a very large set of model variants exposes model internal inconsistencies that would not be apparent in a small set of model simulations, of an order that may be evaluated during model-tuning efforts. Incorporating observations associated with these inconsistencies weakens any forcing constraint because they require a wider range of parameter values to accommodate conflicting information. We show that, by neglecting variables associated with these inconsistencies, it is possible to reduce the parametric uncertainty in global mean aerosol forcing by more than 50 \%, constraining it to a range (around −1.3 to −0.1 W m−2) in close agreement with energy balance constraints. Our estimated aerosol forcing range is the maximum feasible constraint using our structurally imperfect model and the chosen observations. Structural model developments targeted at the identified inconsistencies would enable a larger set of observations to be used for constraint, which would then very likely narrow the uncertainty further and possibly alter the central estimate. Such an approach provides a rigorous pathway to improved model realism and reduced uncertainty that has so far not been achieved through the normal model development approach.},

This is done in the ECHAM-HAM (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast-Hamburg-Hamburg) global climate aerosol model using the M7 microphysics, but high computational costs make it very expensive to run with finer resolution or for a longer time. We aim to use machine learning to emulate the microphysics model at sufficient accuracy and reduce the computational cost by being fast at inference time. The original M7 model is used to generate data of input–output pairs to train a neural network (NN) on it. We are able to learn the variables’ tendencies achieving an average  score of 77.1\%. We further explore methods to inform and constrain the NN with physical knowledge to reduce mass violation and enforce mass positivity. On a Graphics processing unit (GPU), we achieve a speed-up of up to over 64 times faster when compared to the original model.},

	abstract = {Emulators, or reduced complexity climate models, are surrogate Earth system models (ESMs) that produce projections of key climate quantities with minimal computational resources. Using time-series modeling or more advanced machine learning techniques, data-driven emulators have emerged as a promising avenue of research, producing spatially resolved climate responses that are visually indistinguishable from state-of-the-art ESMs. Yet, their lack of physical interpretability limits their wider adoption. In this work, we introduce FaIRGP, a data-driven emulator that satisfies the physical temperature response equations of an energy balance model. The result is an emulator that (a) enjoys the flexibility of statistical machine learning models and can learn from data, and (b) has a robust physical grounding with interpretable parameters that can be used to make inference about the climate system. Further, our Bayesian approach allows a principled and mathematically tractable uncertainty quantification. Our model demonstrates skillful emulation of global mean surface temperature and spatial surface temperatures across realistic future scenarios. Its ability to learn from data allows it to outperform EBMs, while its robust physical foundation safeguards against the pitfalls of purely data-driven models. We also illustrate how FaIRGP can be used to obtain estimates of top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing and discuss the benefits of its mathematical tractability for applications such as detection and attribution or precipitation emulation. We hope that this work will contribute to widening the adoption of data-driven methods in climate emulation.},

	abstract = {Neural Weather Models (NWM) are novel data-driven weather forecasting tools based on neural networks, that have recently achieved comparable deterministic forecast skill to current operational approaches using significantly less real-time computational resources. They require short inference times, which can potentially improve the characterization of forecast uncertainty by designing very large ensembles, which is of paramount importance for for example, extreme events, and critical for various socio-economic sectors. Here we propose a novel ensemble design for NWMs spanning two main sources of uncertainty: model uncertainty and initial condition uncertainty. For the model uncertainty, we propose an effective strategy for creating a diverse ensemble of NWMs that captures uncertainty in key model parameters. For the initial condition uncertainty, we explore the “breeding of growing modes” for the first time on NWMs, a technique traditionally used for operational numerical weather predictions to estimate the initial condition uncertainty. The combination of these two types of uncertainty produces an ensemble of NWM-based forecasts that is shown to improve upon benchmark probabilistic NWM and is competitive with the 50-member ensemble of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), in terms of both error and calibration. Results are particularly promising over land for three key variables: total column water vapor, surface wind and surface air temperature. The proposed strategy is scalable, enabling the generation of very large ensembles ( \{\vphantom{\}} {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}100) with potential applications for extreme events.},

	abstract = {Aerosol particles from both natural and anthropogenic sources play a critical role in the Earth's climate by interacting with solar radiation and clouds. Anthropogenic aerosol and precursor emissions have historically exerted a global cooling effect, which has partially offset the warming from concurrent greenhouse gas emissions. Recent reductions and shifts in aerosol and precursor emission patterns may reduce this offset and introduce spatially and temporarily varying climate impacts. Investigating aerosol-climate effects is typically done with computationally expensive Earth System Models, which include complex representations of physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes and their coupled interactions for the entire global climate system. In this study, we develop a machine-learning climate emulator using Gaussian processes, called AeroGP, that can be used to quickly assess, for example, the impact of different policy decisions on future climate mitigation strategies. The emulator is trained on a unique data set from the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), analyzed as an ensemble here for the first time. AeroGP accounts for the joint spatial covariance of the output variables and captures the complex, heterogeneous impacts of aerosols on surface temperature using coregionalization. We believe this is the first time this method has been used to account for the spatial correlation of such climate data. We show that AeroGP retains the spatial complexity of NorESM at a fraction of the computational cost and demonstrate its usefulness to assess the sensitivity of temperature to idealized future aerosol emission scenarios.},

	abstract = {Aerosols significantly influence Earth's radiative balance, yet considerable uncertainty exists in the underpinning mechanisms, particularly those involving clouds. Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are the most uncertain element in anthropogenic radiative forcing, hampering our ability to constrain Earth's climate sensitivity and understand future climate change. The 2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption in Iceland released sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the lower troposphere on a level comparable to continental-scale emissions. The resultant volcanic plume across an often near-pristine region of the northern North Atlantic Ocean presents an ideal opportunistic experiment to explore ACI representation within general circulation models (GCMs). We present Part 2 of a two-part AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models) Phase III inter-model comparison study that utilises satellite remote sensing observations to assess modelled cloud responses to the Holuhraun attributed volcanic aerosol within eight state-of-the-art GCMs during September and October 2014. We isolate the aerosol effect from meteorological variability and find that the GCMs – particularly their multi-model ensemble response – adeptly capture the observed cloud microphysical changes associated with the ACI first indirect effect (i.e. Twomey effect). Meanwhile, a clear divergence exists in the GCM responses of large-scale cloud properties, namely cloud liquid water content, expected from the precipitation suppression mechanism of the ACI second indirect effect (i.e. rapid adjustments). We attribute this to limitations and differences in their autoconversion schemes under high aerosol loading, specifically in sub-grid-variability representations. Finally, our multi-model ensemble estimates that Holuhraun had a global radiative forcing of −0.11 ± 0.04 Wm−2 across September and October 2014.},

	abstract = {Global climate models (GCMs) face uncertainties in estimating Earth's radiative budget due to aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). Accurate particle number size distributions (PNSDs) are crucial for improving ACI representation, requiring precise modelling of aerosol sources and sinks. Using a Lagrangian trajectory framework, we examine how clouds and precipitation influence aerosols during transport, and thereby influence aerosol–cloud relationships in the boreal forest. Two GCMs, the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1) and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0 with the SALSA2.0 aerosol module (ECHAM-SALSA), are complemented with model-derived trajectories and evaluated against in-situ observations, which are accompanied by reanalysis trajectories. Overall aerosol–precipitation trends are similar between GCMs and observations. However, seasonal differences emerge: in summer, UKESM1 exhibits more efficient aerosol removal via precipitation than ECHAM-SALSA and observations, whereas in winter, the opposite is observed. These differences coincide with key variables controlling aerosol activation, such as sub-grid scale updraught velocities and PNSDs. For example, in winter, removal of total aerosol mass in ECHAM-SALSA was stronger than in UKESM1, coinciding with higher activated fractions and larger sub-grid scale updraught velocities in ECHAM-SALSA. For both GCMs, cloud processing along trajectories increased SO4 mass, mainly in the accumulation mode, consistent with observations and model parametrizations. Discrepancies arise more from differences in PNSDs and updraught velocities than from wet removal parametrizations, an example being the underrepresentation of small particles in UKESM1. While our findings are representative of boreal region with predominantly stratiform precipitation, further work is needed to evaluate their applicability to other regions.},
