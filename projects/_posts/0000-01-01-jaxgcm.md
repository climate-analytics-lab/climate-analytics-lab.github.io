## A Differentiable General Circulation Model

JAX-GCM (JCM) is a groundbreaking fully differentiable General Circulation Model (GCM) designed to bridge traditional climate modeling with modern machine learning techniques. Written entirely in JAX, it represents a new paradigm in climate simulation that enables capabilities previously impossible with conventional models.

### Key Features

**Fully Differentiable**
Every component of the model supports automatic differentiation, enabling gradient-based optimization, data assimilation, and inverse modeling—capabilities that traditional climate models cannot provide.

**GPU/TPU Accelerated**
Leverages JAX's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and hardware acceleration to run efficiently on GPUs and TPUs, dramatically speeding up simulations and enabling rapid iteration.

**Modular Physics**
Includes comprehensive atmospheric physics packages:
- Radiation schemes (shortwave and longwave)
- Convection parameterizations
- Cloud physics
- Surface processes and fluxes
- Vertical diffusion

**Flexible Resolution**
Supports spectral resolutions from T31 (coarse, ~4°) to T425 (high-resolution, ~0.28°), allowing users to balance computational cost with simulation fidelity.

**ML-Ready Architecture**
Designed from the ground up for hybrid physics-ML workflows, parameter optimization, and emulator development. Perfect for neural network integration and data-driven climate science.

### Technical Foundation

JAX-GCM combines:
- **Dinosaur Dynamical Core**: Google Research's spectral dynamical core handles atmospheric dynamics
- **SPEEDY Physics**: Adapted from F. Molteni's simplified parameterization scheme, implemented fully in JAX
- **Modern Python Stack**: Built on Python ≥3.11, XArray, and the scientific Python ecosystem

### Use Cases

The differentiability of JAX-GCM opens new research frontiers:

- **Parameter Optimization**: Gradient descent through the entire model for optimal parameter estimation
- **Data Assimilation**: Efficient incorporation of observational data into model states
- **Hybrid ML Models**: Seamless integration of neural networks into physical parameterizations
- **Climate Sensitivity Studies**: Rapid exploration of model responses to perturbations
- **Emulator Development**: Training fast surrogate models with full-physics guidance
